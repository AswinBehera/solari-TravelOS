 * Actions run, and it can be cancelled at any instant. A handler that ignores
 * `signal` will be killed mid-browser-session and leave a `sessions` row the next
 * boot has to reconcile as `orphaned`; a handler that runs longer than its lease
 * without calling `heartbeat` will have its job claimed out from under it by the
 * next runner and do the work twice.
