/**
 * The lifecycle, and specifically the shutdown path P0.5 exists to get right.
 *
 * GitHub cancels a workflow with SIGTERM and then waits a short, finite grace
 * period before SIGKILL. Three things must happen inside it, in this order, and
 * the order is the whole design:
 *
 * 1. **Stop taking new work.** The abort signal reaches the drain loop between
 *    jobs and the handlers inside them.
 * 2. **Close every live browser session.** Until this happens the provider is
 *    still billing minutes for sessions nobody is attached to — the single most
 *    expensive way to fail, against a $20 ceiling.
 * 3. **Give the claims back.** A released row is claimable by the next runner
 *    immediately and has not been charged an attempt; a row left leased waits out
 *    `leaseMs` first. Step 3 is last because it is the cheapest to lose: the lease
 *    expiry is a correct, if slower, fallback for it, and there is no fallback at
 *    all for step 2.
 *
 * The grace period is not ours to choose, so nothing here waits on anything it
 * does not have to. A second SIGTERM exits immediately — an operator sending it
 * twice means "now", and arguing with that is how a process becomes unkillable.
