/**
 * The API (ADR-0014: Hono on Cloudflare Workers, free plan).
 *
 * The free plan allows **10 ms of CPU per invocation** — not wall clock, which is
 * why a handler may wait on Hyperdrive for far longer than that and still fit. The
 * rule this imposes on every route below: validate, enqueue, read, serialise.
 * Nothing parses a harvested page, scores anything, or loops over a result set of
 * unbounded size. Where that rule is about to be broken the work belongs in
 * `apps/worker`, which runs on a machine that is allowed to think.
 *
 * Built as a factory over injected dependencies rather than reading bindings
 * directly, for two reasons: the CPU measurement in `cpu.test.ts` has to drive the
 * real handlers without a Workers runtime, and the SSE query-count bound from
 * ADR-0016 has to be asserted against a counting store.

   * - **One query per tick.** Events carry their own state, so there is no second

   *   afterwards. A flat one-second poll is 86,400 queries a day per tab against a
   *   100,000-a-day account ceiling.
   * - **A bounded lifetime.** The stream closes itself; the client reconnects if
   *   the human is still there, and does not if they are not.
   *
   * The bound this produces is asserted by `stream.test.ts` against
   * `maxStreamQueries()`, computed from the same schedule so the two cannot drift.
