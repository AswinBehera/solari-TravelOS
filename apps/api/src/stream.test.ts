/**
 * P0.5's second acceptance criterion (ADR-0016): *a bounded query count for an SSE
 * stream held across a real harvest*.
 *
 * The number being defended is not this app's. Hyperdrive's free plan meters
 * 100,000 queries a day **account-wide** — shared by every environment, every
 * branch preview, and every other service on the account. So the failure this test
 * exists to prevent is not "the stream is slow", it is "one tab left open on a
 * laptop lid overnight exhausts the quota and every other request starts failing".
 * That failure is invisible in development, where no tab lives long enough, which
 * is exactly why it needs a test rather than care.
 *
 * The bound is compared against `maxStreamQueries()`, which is computed by walking
 * `streamPollIntervalMs` — the same function the handler calls. Writing the
 * expected number here as a literal would let a later edit to the schedule pass
 * this test while quietly tripling the real cost.
