/**
 * `workflow_dispatch` (ADR-0016, decision 2).
 *
 * Foreground work is dispatched, not scheduled: a user who triggers a harvest and
 * then watches a five-minute cron floor is watching a product that looks dead.
 *
 * Three properties of the GitHub endpoint shape this file, and all three are
 * awkward:
 *
 * - **It returns 204 with no run id.** The run has to be correlated afterwards by
 *   the job id passed as an input, which is why `jobId` is an input rather than
 *   being encoded in the ref or the workflow name.
 * - **It is rate limited**, and a dispatch that fails must not fail the enqueue.
 *   The row is already in Postgres; cron will pick it up late, which is worse than
 *   instant and much better than lost.
 * - **It is asynchronous.** Nothing here waits for the run to start.
