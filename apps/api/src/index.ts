/**
 * This module exports **only** the default handler, and that is a runtime rule

 * has a named export that is not a handler or a Durable Object class
 * (`Incorrect type for map entry 'PACKAGE': the provided value is not of type
 * 'function or ExportedHandler'`). The P0.1 convention of "every package exports its
 * own name" does not apply here, because this is an entrypoint, not a library.
 * Tests import `./app.js` and the other modules directly.

/**
 * One app per isolate, built lazily on the first request.
 *
 * Cloudflare reuses an isolate across many requests, so anything built here is
 * paid for once rather than per invocation — which matters more than usual against
 * a 10 ms CPU ceiling. What must *not* be hoisted is the database connection:
 * Hyperdrive hands out a pooled connection per request, and holding one across
 * requests in a long-lived isolate is how a pool gets exhausted by an API that
 * looks idle.
