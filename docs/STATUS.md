# STATUS

Phase: 1 — in progress. Phase 0 is **complete, pending the gate** (below; the gate is a human
review and does not block buildable work).
Last completed: **P1.5 — the Google Maps adapter**, plus **one live capture that came back
refused**. `maps.search` and `maps.reviews`, registered in `apps/worker` alongside the YouTube and
TikTok pairs. 209 tests in `@samsara/sources` (84 new), **0.270 browser minutes spent**, seam
allowances **0 of 5** across 127 files.

**The one capture found a third outcome, and it was not the one I was watching for.** Asking
`อารีย์` from a `th-TH` persona did not return a result list: Maps decided a one-word Thai area name
was unambiguous, resolved it to the street that names the area, and navigated to that entity's own
page. No result cards, and on that build no state blob either — every structural signal the refusal
rule had said *blocked*, and nothing had gone wrong. The rule is now *a search with no cards and no
blob is a refusal **unless** the landing address carries a feature id*, and `parse` emits one draft
for the resolved entity. That draft's real value is not the item: it is a **valid input to
`maps.reviews`**, which is the whole reason the search surface is a separate adapter. A session that
produced zero usable outputs now produces the one output the chain consumes.

**The identity mechanism proved out on real bytes, in a use it was not designed for.** The `0x…:0x…`
→ `cid` conversion was built for P1.8's overlap measurement; it is also the only part of a Maps
address readable without understanding the rest of it, which is what makes "resolved" legible at
all. `https://maps.google.com/?cid=7848097478468591393`, from the live URL, first try.

**All three names for the state blob were wrong** — `stateKeys` came back empty. The diagnostic did
its job and then stopped one question short: it reports which guesses were present, not what is
actually there. Added `stateCandidates`, which reports `window` key *names* matching a state-global
shape, sorted and capped, values never leaving the page. Third time this shape has come up, so it is
worth stating as a rule: **a diagnostic that reports whether you were right is worth one session; a
diagnostic that reports what the right answer is, is worth all of them.**

**`gl` did not survive the navigation** — sent, absent from the landing URL, while `hl` came through.
P1.3's `persist_gl` finding on a different source. Not acted on (region plausibly comes from the
egress IP, as on TikTok) but now asserted, so the day it changes something fails and says so.

**What the capture did not buy**: no review and no result card has ever been read by this parser, so
every selector in `inpage.ts` is still a guess. `fixture.test.ts` says so in its own header. See
`casestudy_and_thinking/sessions/2026-09-13-p15b-the-answer-was-in-the-address-bar.md`.

**Maps has no names, so the strategy that made the last two adapters writable blind does not
transfer.** YouTube tags its results with renderer names and TikTok's items are at least keyed
objects; `APP_INITIALIZATION_STATE` is anonymous nested arrays, and a tree search by key name has
nothing to search for. This surface is read from the **DOM** instead, which moves field extraction
inside `page.evaluate` — into the half that spends. The line that survives the move is narrower than
"parse does the parsing": *the in-page half selects and copies strings; it does not interpret them.*
The practical test is whether changing our mind about what a rating means costs a browser session.
It does not — that work is still in `parse`. What a **selector** change now costs is a session, and
saying so here is cheaper than discovering it later; it is also why `jsdom` is now a test-only
dependency, declared per file with `/** @vitest-environment jsdom */` rather than package-wide.

**Two adapters, because one would spend an unbounded amount.** "Search an area, then open each
result" is a single billed session whose length is a function of a page nobody has loaded yet —
invisible to the kernel's per-session meters until it ends. Split instead: `maps.search` takes an
area or a category, `maps.reviews` takes **an entity URL as its query**, and the chaining is the
caller's, on the P1.1 precedent that a list of areas is a job-payload argument and never a constant
inside the engine. Second dividend: a failure at the eighth entity of ten loses one capture, not
ten. `buildReviewsUrl` refuses any host that is not Google's — an adapter that will navigate
anywhere on request is a proxy with our egress address on it.

**The diagnostics are the design.** Three things about Maps cannot be known without paying: which
tab is the reviews tab (localised, so matched by position), whether `data-review-id` still anchors a
review, and whether the blob is still called `APP_INITIALIZATION_STATE`. Every capture records what
it saw — `tabLabels`, `nodeCounts`, `stateKeys`, `observedPaths`, `strategies` — so **one** capture
answers all three, including a capture that failed. Generalises P1.4's `observedPaths`.

**Redaction by shape, not by key name — and only because nothing reads the field.** Every other
adapter redacts a keyed tree by name; Maps' one opaque field is a *string*, so the only available
filter is a pattern (JWTs, `AIza…` keys, `ya29.` tokens, `SAPISIDHASH`). That is a denylist, which
this file has twice called the problem. It is acceptable here for one reason that inverts the
trade-off: nothing parses the blob, so over-redaction costs nothing, where over-redacting TikTok's
`signature` destroyed an author's bio.

**Identity comes from the feature id, and that was an accident worth keeping.** `place` is in the
seam's `FORBIDDEN_IN_CODE` tier and is also Google's own noun. Neither escape was acceptable — a
`seam:allow` would burn two of five on a word that is not the engine knowing about travel, and
assembling the string at runtime is evading your own checker. Looking for an identifier that avoided
the word instead found the hex pair `0x…:0x…`, which is regex-extractable without understanding the
blob and converts to `https://maps.google.com/?cid=<decimal>` with one `BigInt`. The raw Maps URL
carries a viewport and a session-shaped `data=` segment, so it **differs between two captures of the
same entity** — which would not have failed loudly in P1.8's URL-overlap measurement. It would have
reported zero overlap and read like a finding.

**A real bug in `counts.ts`, found by a realistic Vietnamese string.** `parseCount("231 bài đánh
giá")` returned 231,000,000,000: `b` is a complete scale word in the table and `bài` starts with it.
Fixed where the bug was rather than in the Maps parser — a Latin-script scale word must not be
immediately followed by another Latin-script letter — with Thai deliberately exempt, because Thai is
written without spaces and `1.2 ล้านครั้ง` has a letter directly after the scale word. Third session
running in which the bug surfaced because the test string was realistic rather than convenient. See
`casestudy_and_thinking/sessions/2026-09-13-p15-the-surface-with-no-names.md`.

Before that: **P1.4 — the TikTok adapter.** `tiktok.search` and `tiktok.explore`, registered in
`apps/worker` alongside the YouTube pair. 77 tests in `@samsara/sources`, **0 browser minutes
spent**, seam allowances **0 of 5** across 111 files.

**The brief ruled out more than it ruled in.** The plan names TikTok as the surface most likely to
gate on IP geolocation and says to report the gap rather than work around it — so there is no
captcha solving, no signature forging, no rotating personas until one is let through. The refusal
*is* the measurement: P1.0's finding (query language dominant, egress worth about as much as waiting
five minutes) was measured on a surface that honours `gl` and `hl` as URL parameters, and whether it
survives a surface that enforces geography is the open question. TikTok takes exactly one viewpoint
parameter in a URL — `lang` — and region comes from the egress IP alone, which is why this adapter
and not YouTube's is the one that actually tests ADR-0015's `sg`-for-`th` compromise.

`refusedBy` distinguishes **three** walls. `region-block` is the finding. `captcha` is a judgement
about this session and feeds persona health. `login-wall` applies to every logged-out visitor and
degrades a persona that did nothing wrong — an admitted cost, taken because a harvest that silently
returns nothing from behind a wall is worse. And both strategies coming back empty is *not* `empty`:
it means we could not read what TikTok sent, which is a different row and a different thing to fix.

**Recognition is structural, because TikTok does not name its items.** YouTube tags results with
renderer names; TikTok's items are anonymous objects in arrays whose names change per endpoint. The
predicate is a digit-string `id`, a `desc` that is a string, and an `author` or `stats` — strict on
purpose, because a loose one returns music tracks and hashtags as videos and every one of those gets
stored as evidence and scored.

**Two entries came off the redaction denylist for destroying content.** `signature` on a TikTok
author is the account bio — free text in the local language, exactly what this project harvests.
`userInfo` is the viewer in `SIGI_STATE` and a *result* in the search API, and key-name redaction
cannot tell them apart. This is the second time in three sessions a denylist has been the problem;
it survives only because there is no type-level alternative for bytes a third party sent us.

**A doc comment of mine was false and a test proved it.** `guessLanguage` claimed Vietnamese
diacritics are "present in almost any real Vietnamese sentence" — true of sentences, false of the
four-word captions it will actually be handed. `bánh mì ngon quá` contains nothing outside Latin-1.
Not fixed by widening the character class, which would report Spanish as Vietnamese; fixed by
correcting the claim, asserting the limitation in a test, and preferring the source's own language
field. The mechanism is worth keeping: the bug was in prose, and it surfaced only because the test
string was realistic rather than convenient. See
`casestudy_and_thinking/sessions/2026-09-13-p14-the-surface-that-says-no.md`.

Before that: **P1.3 — the YouTube adapter.** `youtube.search` and `youtube.trending` are two
adapters sharing one parser, `harvest.run` is wired into `apps/worker`, and 44 tests in
`@samsara/sources` pass without a single one of them having seen YouTube. **0 browser minutes
spent**, seam allowances still **0 of 5** across 103 files.

**The one step not taken, which needs a decision.** No live capture has been recorded, so
`youtube.fixture.test.ts` does not exist. Recording it opens a browser session through a paid
provider — about a cent against a 4,000-minute ceiling, trivial as money and not trivial as a
precedent — and writes the resulting bytes into a **public** repository, where the only protection
is an 11-key redaction denylist. The recorder is built and its dry run is correct; the command is
`pnpm --filter @dt/worker record -- --query="…" --country=sg --locale=vi-VN`. Until then
`parse.test.ts` states in its own header that its hand-built trees test the parser's behaviour and
do **not** establish that the shape is right.

Three shapes worth carrying forward: **two adapters, one parser** (`sourceId` is what a stored row
is grouped and re-parsed by, and a search result is not the same evidence as a trending slot);
**the parser searches for five renderer names rather than walking a path**, because names are the
stable part of YouTube's response and containers are not, while preserving encounter order because
encounter order is rank order; and **redaction is a key-name list, not a narrowing of the payload**
— storing only the results container would move parsing into the half that spends, after which
every layout change costs a browser session instead of a parser edit.

`counts.ts` returns `null` rather than guess: 12 scale words across 3 languages, Thai counting in
powers of ten thousand, and `,` meaning a thousands separator in one language and a decimal point
in another. A mis-scaled view count ranks content while looking entirely reasonable; a missing one
is visibly missing.

**A known hazard stopped being theoretical.** The shared test-database note below had sat unacted
on since P1.1. Adding a third package that truncates the same four tables turned it into five
`.pg.test.ts` failures under `pnpm check` that passed individually and were not the same five
twice. Fixed with a Postgres advisory lock held for the length of each pg test file
(`@samsara/db/testing`) rather than `--concurrency=1`, which would have serialised twenty-six
tasks to resolve a conflict between three and re-introduced the bug silently on the next package
to open a connection. Parallel suite: **9.6s green** against 26.7s for the serial workaround, four
consecutive runs at 26/26. See
`casestudy_and_thinking/sessions/2026-09-13-p13-the-first-real-source.md`.

Before that: **P1.2 — `@samsara/sources` + `@samsara/harvest`.** The adapter contract and the
orchestration around it. 43 new tests, **zero browser minutes spent** building either, seam
allowances still **0 of 5** across 92 files.

The shape that matters: **the adapter is two methods, and the split is a type rather than a
convention.** `capture(ctx, query)` spends browser minutes; `parse(capture)` is synchronous and is
handed only bytes — no page, no signal, no clock — so an adapter cannot fetch while parsing even
by accident. The plan's justification for this whole phase ("parser iteration opens no browsers …
the single largest saving available") is not deliverable by the single `harvest()` the plan
specified: that signature *permits* the separation without creating it. The stored fixture is a
recorded `Capture`, byte for byte identical to what the archive holds, so a parser test and a
re-parse of a real run execute the same code on the same bytes and cannot drift apart.

Two findings from the session:

**One design bug, mine, caught by a test.** An archive failure was first written as non-fatal:
log it, skip the items, carry on. That produced a run marked `ok` with zero items behind it —
forty items parsed, nothing written, a `harvest_runs` row that reads like a good day. Archive
failure is now fatal to the run. An item with no `rawRef` looks like evidence and can never be
re-read when the extraction model changes; a loud outage that re-spends minutes beats a quiet
corruption that does not.

**The seam checker was blind in both of the languages this product is for.** `"ที่เที่ยวกรุงเทพ"`
sat in an engine test through a green `check:seam` — `กรุงเทพ` is Bangkok, which is in the tier
scanned *everywhere*. `segments()` splits on `[^A-Za-z0-9]+`, so Thai text is erased before the
comparison rather than failing it; Vietnamese breaks into `kh`, `ch`, `s`, `n`. Caught by a human
reading a diff, which is the failure mode the file exists to eliminate. Fixed with a third tier,
`FORBIDDEN_SUBSTRINGS`, matched as lowercased substrings because Thai has no word boundaries to
match on, plus three regression tests — one of them asserting an ordinary Thai greeting still
passes, so the tier does not degrade into "non-Latin text is suspicious". The general form is
worth keeping: **every mechanical guard has an undocumented domain of applicability, and the leak
goes exactly there.**

No `harvest.run` job type is registered in `apps/worker`, deliberately: `runHarvest` takes an
adapter and there is none until P1.3, so a registry with no entries would be a job type that
always fails. Wiring lands with the first real source. See
`casestudy_and_thinking/sessions/2026-09-12-p12-the-split-and-the-blind-checker.md`.

Before that: **P1.1 — `@samsara/personas`.** The identity package: create, health state
machine, ban detection, `keepalive`. 54 tests, **zero browser minutes spent** building it, seam
allowances still **0 of 5** across 82 files.

The session's finding is that four separate defects here would each have produced a **perfectly
green run** — no failing test, no alert, no symptom:

| silence | what it looks like when it happens |
|---|---|
| profile never `save`d | session opens, pages load, row says `ok`, identity accumulates nothing |
| `403` classified as `internal` | refusal is **retried** against the surface that just refused; nothing ever recorded `blocked` |
| `seeded` silently downgraded to `anon` | persona counts as seeded in every listing for weeks |
| read-modify-write on the minute counter | two concurrent runners lose an update, always *downward*, under a hard ceiling |

The second is the serious one and it was found by a test failing for the wrong reason:
**the ban detector could not have detected a ban.** Playwright's `goto` does not throw on a
refusal — it returns a response carrying the status — so every real block classified as `internal`,
and `internal` is the one `retry.ts` retries. Fixed in the kernel with a `Blocked` error class that
`classify` recognises by instance, before any string matching.

Two decisions worth carrying forward: the **health streak is derived from `sessions` rows, not
stored** (so a threshold change is retroactive rather than leaving personas banned under a rule
nobody can reconstruct), and **`timezone_id` is a stored column** rather than derived from country
or locale — P1.0 measured those apart, and an identity whose clock is computed from its IP cannot
express that result. That makes `Viewpoint` `{country, locale, timezoneId}` in the persona row,
which answers gate question 1 by building it. See
`casestudy_and_thinking/sessions/2026-09-12-p11-the-identity.md`.

Before that: **P1.0 — the signal-matrix experiment, run.** 18 cells, 4.79 browser-minutes of
4,000, and a result that changes the priority order for P1.3–P1.6:

| factor | effect | vs a 21% noise floor |
|---|---:|---|
| **query language** | **100%** (0 shared results of 20) | **dominant** |
| egress country | 31% | weak |
| browser locale + clock | 23% | weak |
| stored region preference | 20% | **noise** |

**Asking in Thai and asking in English return completely disjoint lists** — same IP, same browser,
same second. Everything else is at or barely above what repeating a single cell produces. The
honest answer to "how do you get local content without a local IP" is: *you ask in the local
language*. ADR-0015 described a graded stack; the measurement shows a cliff, and mildly disagrees
about the ordering below it (egress sits at the top of the weak cluster, not the bottom) — see
`casestudy_and_thinking/sessions/2026-09-12-p10b-the-result.md`, which also records that the run
found a 32% under-report in its own billing and what was done about it. One surface, one query,
one day; the `Surface` interface exists so a second costs a file.

Before that: **P1.0, the zero-cost half.** The signal-matrix experiment is designed, built and
tested without opening a single session: the factorial machinery, pairwise overlap, factor effects,
noise floor and seeded run order live in `@samsara/harvest` (29 tests, no network); the two query
strings, the locale-to-clock map, the region hints and the YouTube surface live in a new `@dt/lab`
package (15 tests). Writing the design down found four flaws in the plan's one-sentence version of
the experiment, none of which needed a session to discover — see
`casestudy_and_thinking/sessions/2026-09-12-p10-designing-the-experiment.md`.
Before that: **P0.8** (the acceptance run): Phase 0's own three acceptance criteria executed
literally for the first time. Criterion 3 held. **Criteria 1 and 2 were both false and had been
for days, with no symptoms.** A fresh clone following the README produced `67 passed | 14
skipped`, exit 0, testing none of the job store; and the `@live` test had never written a
session row to Postgres at all, because it used a memory store for both session and counters.
Both fixed, both re-verified from a clean clone: **31 seconds** to a green `pnpm check` against
a 10-minute budget, 148 tests including all 13 Postgres ones, `pnpm dev` verified end to end in
the clone, `@live` green with row `e9330835` in `sessions`, seam ok at 65 files with **zero
allows of five**. A third finding fell out of the live run — `Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh` and
`Asia/Saigon` are one zone under two spellings and ICU answers with the older one, so the
viewpoint check was reporting a false negative. Before that, **P0.7** (the seam check),
**P0.6** (dev ergonomics) and **P0.5** (the queue and the two runtimes); all three were
committed this session, having lived only in the working tree until now.
NEXT: **P1.6 (Pantip)** — or, first, **one `maps.reviews` capture**, which is a decision rather than
a task. All three adapters now have a recorded fixture, but the Maps one is of a page with no items
on it, so the nine selector plans in `reviewPlan` remain entirely unmeasured. One session against
`https://maps.google.com/?cid=7848097478468591393` (the entity the last capture resolved to) answers
`nodeCounts`, `tabLabels`, `tabOpened` and `stateCandidates` at once, including if it comes back
refused. A street is a poor thing to ask for reviews of, so a named business in Ari is the better
query — and that also tests whether the search surface ever returns a list.
And **the Phase 0 gate** (see below), whose fourth question — P1.0 measured the signal stack and it
does not match ADR-0015's ordering — is still open. Gate question 1 (`Viewpoint`'s shape) is now
answered in code: `{country, locale, timezoneId}`, stored on the persona row and read straight
through by `CapturePersona`.
Half-resolved: `jobs.pg.test.ts`, `personas.pg.test.ts` and `harvest.pg.test.ts` no longer
truncate *each other* — a Postgres advisory lock in `@samsara/db/testing` serialises them across
processes. They still truncate the same database `pnpm dev` drains, which remains an architect's
call: harmless while the dev data is disposable, and not the day it is not. The lock makes the
suite correct; it does not make the choice of database correct.
Also unresolved: no live capture has been recorded, so nothing in `@samsara/sources` has been
executed against a real page. The `CaptureArchive` decision is still live (no Supabase
credentials), and `FilesystemCaptureArchive` is an explicit stand-in that does not survive an
Actions runner.
Branch: main
Known breakage: none. (The 0003/0004 gap from last session is closed — Docker was started, all six
migrations are recorded, and `places.external_ref`/`resolved_tier` are live.)

Last session notes:
- 2026-09-11 (Claude Code) — session 2
  - **Budget.** Aswin set a hard **$20 ceiling** for the whole demo. Section 8 rewritten around it:
    three meters (Solari minutes, LLM tokens, geocoding calls), each with a ceiling expressed as a
    **count** rather than dollars, because rates drift and counts do not. Section 2.4's budget guard
    is now three-metered, and P0.4 gained an acceptance criterion that drives each meter past its
    ceiling and asserts the refusal. The guard is no longer a Phase 8 concern.
  - **ADR-0012: OpenRouter is the LLM gateway.** Amends ADR-0006. One key, many models; the model
    for each task is an env var, never a literal. The point is not the markup — it is that the
    extraction model gets chosen at P2.1 by measurement, and replaying stored RawItems costs
    nothing on the Solari meter, so the bake-off is affordable. Known cost: the Anthropic Batch
    API's 50% discount is not reachable through OpenRouter. Accepted.
  - **P0.1 done.** pnpm workspaces + Turborepo 2 + Biome 2 + Vitest 3 + TS 5.9. 16 workspace
    projects: 9 under `packages/samsara/`, 4 under `packages/travel/`, 3 apps. Every package is a
    stub exporting its own name. `pnpm check` (lint, typecheck, test) is green.
  - `.env` holds a real `SOLARI_API_KEY`, is gitignored (verified with `git check-ignore`), and was
    written with `umask 077`. `.env.example` created with every variable the plan implies so far,
    including the four budget ceilings.
  - Cookbook `examples/` untouched, as P0.1 requires. Biome explicitly excludes them.

  - **P0.2 done.** `@samsara/core` has schemas for all nine engine entities; `@dt/core` has the
    five travel ones. 25 tests: every schema parses a fixture, plus the constraints that are
    actually load-bearing (country must be lowercase, `SessionPurpose` stays closed, confidence is
    bounded, every score carries its `because`). `@samsara/core` depends on zod and nothing else.
  - **The seam bit back immediately, which is a good sign.** The first draft of the engine's
    fixtures used travel vocabulary — Bangkok, a restaurant query, agoda as a source — to make the
    examples readable. That would have failed P0.7's lexicon check, correctly: if the engine's own
    fixtures need a vertical's words to be legible, the schemas are not agnostic. Rewritten around
    a made-up domain called `atlas`. Worth knowing before P0.7 lands, because it means the check
    will find real things, not just typos.
  - `packages/samsara/core/src/seam.test.ts` is a narrow, package-local version of the seam check:
    no `@dt/*` import statement, no `@dt/*` dependency, and nothing but zod in `dependencies`.
    P0.7 generalises it; this one stays, because it fails in the package that broke the rule.

  - **Q3 answered: Supabase Auth** (ADR-0013). The API verifies the JWT and passes `sub` down as an
    opaque `ownerId`; the travel `users` table keys on that id rather than generating its own. No
    RLS in v1 — the worker writes rows for users who are not present, which RLS fights, and
    authorisation lives in the API layer, the only place that has the request identity. This
    decision touched nothing under `packages/samsara/`, which is a small test of the seam passing.
  - **P0.3 done, verified against a live Postgres.** 14 tables (9 engine, 5 travel), 12 enum types,
    one migration (`0000_lying_menace.sql`), seed runs and is idempotent. `docker-compose.yml` at
    the root brings up Postgres 17 and Redis 7 with healthchecks; `pnpm db:up`, `db:migrate`,
    `db:seed`, `db:reset` wrap it.
  - **The seam holds at the database level, and this is now checked two ways.** Queried live:
    zero foreign keys from any engine table into any travel table. Also asserted structurally in
    `packages/travel/db/src/schema.test.ts`, so CI catches a regression without needing Postgres.
    The check is not vacuous — the same logic finds all 14 real foreign keys.

  - **Q1 answered: Cloudflare** (ADR-0014) — and it forced a bigger change than the question asked.
    Free Workers meter **CPU, not wall clock**, at 10 ms per invocation. `apps/web` and `apps/api`
    fit; `apps/worker` cannot, because parsing a harvested page is computation, not I/O. So the
    worker is a **scheduled GitHub Actions job**, and once the consumer is a job that wakes,
    drains, and exits, the queue is a Postgres table — **BullMQ and Redis are both gone**, along
    with the always-on box and its monthly fee. Section 2.2 rewritten; ADR-0004 superseded; Redis
    removed from `docker-compose.yml` and `.env.example`.
  - The kernel's budget counters move from Redis keys to Postgres rows keyed by meter and window.
    This is more correct regardless: a guard that forgets what it spent when a runner exits is not
    a guard.

- 2026-09-11 (Claude Code) — session 3
  - **P0.4 done, and a live session actually opened.** `@samsara/kernel` is nine source files plus
    two store backends. `withBrowser` refuses on the guard, opens, registers, races a hard deadline,
    force-closes on overrun, closes in a `finally`, and meters the minutes the session really took.
    62 tests, none of which need a key or spend anything: `ports.ts` defines `BrowserLauncher` and
    `SandboxLauncher`, and `solari.ts` is the only file in the repository that imports the SDK.
  - **First real number for the minutes meter: 0.042 minutes** for a probe session that opened a
    residential-proxied browser, loaded ipify, and closed. Against a 4,000-minute ceiling, a probe
    costs about 0.001% of the demo's Solari budget. Solari is up, not in maintenance.
  - **The live test found a product blocker, not a bug: Solari has no Thai residential egress.**
    `country: "th"` returns `400 Unsupported proxy country` with the pool inlined — 15 countries,
    no `th`. Section 1.4 names Bangkok as the first city. Recorded in
    `packages/samsara/kernel/src/countries.ts`, flagged in section 1.4, and asked as section 10
    question 9. The kernel refuses `th` locally and names `sg` as the nearest available, but does
    not substitute it: a silent country swap changes what a persona sees, which is the one variable
    the Persona Lab exists to hold still. **This needs Aswin's call before P1.**
  - The same 400 exposed a real defect on the way: `classify` had no 4xx branch, so it called the
    provider's "you asked for something that does not exist" `internal` and then retried it twice.
    Now 4xx is `config`, and `config` is not retryable.
  - **Q1's answer changed the logger's type, not just a config value.** The repository is public, so
    the Actions log is public. `KernelEvent` is a closed discriminated union with **no free-form
    `payload` or `meta` field anywhere** — logging a secret does not typecheck. `registry.test.ts`
    asserts every emitted key against an allowlist, so adding one fails the build. A redaction
    denylist would have been the obvious design and the wrong one; denylists leak by omission.

  - **Q2 answered, and it tightens everything: the $20 IS the usage credit.** No free runtime
    underneath it; overage bills Aswin's card, which is not acceptable. Section 8 rewritten. Three
    consequences, all in code: the ceiling is a stop and not a warning; the ~$4 unallocated is
    **reserve against our own undercount** (a killed runner leaves a VM billing while our counter
    records nothing — routine under ADR-0014) and must not be allocated; and **the one remaining
    card exposure is Google Places**, which auto-bills once its free credit runs out. Places needs a
    hard daily **quota cap** (not a budget alert — alerts only send mail) before Phase 2. Until then
    geocoding runs on Nominatim only.
  - **ADR-0015: a viewpoint is a stack of signals, and the IP is the weakest one.** This answers
    question 9 and keeps Bangkok as the first city. Platforms rank by account region, query
    language, stored region preference, browser locale/timezone, engagement history, and only then
    egress IP. A Thai IP asking in English gets the global viral feed; a `th-TH` browser on
    `Asia/Bangkok` asking in Thai does not.
  - **A real bug fell out of writing that down: Solari sets neither locale nor timezone.**
    `browser.newPage()` returns the pool's default context — `en-US` on UTC. Every session the
    kernel had opened was claiming to be an American on a Singapore IP: wrong for the product and a
    conspicuous mismatch for the anti-bot surfaces. The kernel now builds its own context, carrying
    the profile's `storageState` across by hand (`newContext()` opens an *empty* one — losing a
    warmed profile that way would have been silent).
  - **Verified live:** egress `121.7.135.149` (Singapore residential), page reports
    `navigator.language = th-TH`, `Intl` zone `Asia/Bangkok`, offset −420. 0.057 minutes.
  - **`sessions` records both halves** (`locale`, `timezone_id`, migration 0002), and so does the
    `session.open` log event. An Observation cannot be read without the viewpoint that produced it,
    and "which signals were present" is the independent variable of every Phase 1 experiment.
  - **New task P1.0, ahead of the adapters:** a signal-matrix experiment — one query across egress x
    locale x query-language x stored-preference, measuring pairwise URL overlap. Under 10 browser
    minutes. It turns "we can't get a Thai IP" into a measured table of what actually matters, and
    the adapters get built against measured weights instead of assumed ones.
  - ADRs 0001 to 0008 written, so 0001 to 0015 all exist.

- 2026-09-12 (Claude Code) — session 4
  - **Migrations 0003/0004 applied**, plus a new **0005** for the queue. Six recorded, `places` has
    `external_ref` and `resolved_tier`, `places_google_id_idx` and `google_place_id` are gone.
  - **P0.5 done.** The queue is `jobs` + `job_events`. The claim is **one statement** — a CTE that
    selects `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` and updates in the same round trip — never a select followed by
    an update, which is the shape that hands one row to two runners.
  - **The design decision underneath it: a cancelled runner is routine, not an incident.** GitHub can
    cancel a scheduled run at any moment, so every claim carries a `lease_until`. An expired lease is
    reclaimable by the next runner, which means the *default* recovery path needs no operator and no
    dead-letter queue. Shutdown is the fast path on top of that, not the only path.
  - **A real bug that came out of writing the shutdown path:** `runOne` was routing a SIGTERM-aborted
    handler through `classify()` into `fail()`, so a cancelled job consumed an attempt and got backoff
    applied. Three unlucky cancellations would retire a job that had never actually been tried. Also,
    with `batchSize > 1`, rows 2..n of an aborted batch were claimed but never released. Both fixed:
    every claimed row is held from the instant it is claimed, and cancellation returns `"released"`,
    a third outcome next to succeeded and failed. **Cancellation is not failure** is now a type.
  - **ADR-0016 acceptance criterion 1 — CPU per request.** Measured with `process.cpuUsage()` over 500
    real requests through the real handlers (`apps/api/src/cpu.test.ts`), against the free plan's
    **10 ms** ceiling:

    | route                      | CPU per request | share of ceiling |
    | -------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
    | `POST /jobs`               | **0.067 ms**    | 0.7%             |
    | `GET /jobs/:id/events` (1 tick) | **0.057 ms** | 0.6%            |
    | `GET /health`              | **0.016 ms**    | 0.2%             |

    Stated honestly: this is a **proxy**. Workers meters CPU rather than wall clock, and it freezes
    `Date.now()`/`performance.now()` between I/O precisely so that a Worker cannot time itself — so
    the authoritative number comes from the Cloudflare dashboard after deploy. This test's job is to
    catch a regression in CI two orders of magnitude before the ceiling. The assertion is set at half
    the ceiling, not at it.
  - **ADR-0016 acceptance criterion 2 — bounded stream queries.** A stream held its entire 15-minute
    lifetime across a job that never finishes costs **76 Hyperdrive queries**, against **900** for the
    flat one-second poll ADR-0016 rejected. The bound is asserted against `maxStreamQueries()`, which
    is computed by walking `streamPollIntervalMs` — the same function the handler calls — so editing
    the schedule cannot leave the test passing against a number that is no longer true. A finished job
    costs exactly one query.
  - `wrangler.toml` (Hyperdrive binding, `nodejs_compat`), `.github/workflows/worker.yml`
    (`schedule` + `workflow_dispatch` with a `jobId` input, `concurrency: worker`,
    `cancel-in-progress: false`), and the new `.env.example` entries — names only, no values.
  - **ADR-0019** records this session's two structural decisions and why the alternatives lose.

  - **P0.6 done, and the dev loop was verified end to end rather than assumed.** `pnpm dev` brings
    up Postgres, then three persistent turbo tasks: Vite on :5173, `wrangler dev` on :8788, and the
    runner on a 3-second timer. Checked by hand: `/health` through Vite's proxy into workerd returns
    `{"ok":true,"service":"api"}`, and the runner picked up and drained a leftover `noop` row
    (attempt 2, `reclaimed: 1` — lease expiry reclaiming a row in reality, not in a test).
  - **Verified the risky unknown: postgres-js works inside workerd.** A throwaway probe worker
    enqueued a job through Hyperdrive's local connection string and read its event back. The whole
    chain — workerd → `nodejs_compat` → postgres-js → drizzle → Postgres 17 — is confirmed locally,
    which is the part that would otherwise have been discovered on deploy day.
  - **A real defect the first `wrangler dev` found:** workerd refuses to start if the entrypoint
    module has a named export that is not a handler (`Incorrect type for map entry 'PACKAGE'`). P0.1's
    "every package exports its own name" convention is correct for libraries and wrong for an
    entrypoint. `apps/api/src/index.ts` now exports only the default handler; the other modules are
    reachable through subpath exports, with the reason written above the code.
  - **Second defect, found by reasoning rather than by a crash:** the Supabase verifier was built at
    isolate boot, so `SUPABASE_URL` was required before `/health` — an unauthenticated route — could
    answer. Now built on first authenticated use. A clean checkout with nothing but Docker running is
    enough for `pnpm dev`.
  - **Third, small and real:** `main()` registered SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers with `once` and never
    removed them. `once` only unregisters a listener that fires, so calling `main()` repeatedly (the
    dev loop; tests) leaked one per call and would have announced itself as a
    MaxListenersExceededWarning on the eleventh drain. Removed in the `finally`.
  - **The dev worker is a loop around the real `main()`, not a daemon.** Production has no long-lived
    worker, so dev must not invent one — a persistent dev worker hides every bug that only appears
    because the process *ends* between jobs.
  - `apps/web` is now a real Vite app (React 19, Tailwind v4, TanStack Query). One page, which calls
    `/health` and shows a dot. It is deliberately not a hello-world: a page that renders without
    touching the proxy, the Worker and the database would let the whole chain break and still look
    green, which is the failure P0.6 exists to remove.


- 2026-09-12 (Claude Code) — session 5

  - **P0.8 is not in the plan.** Phase 0's task list ends at P0.7. What was left was the phase's
    own **acceptance criteria and gate**, which is what this session did. Worth recording
    because the result argues for making that a numbered task everywhere: two of the three
    criteria were false, both had been false for days, and neither had produced a symptom.

  - **P0.5, P0.6 and P0.7 are committed.** They had lived only in the working tree — 69 files,
    HEAD still at P0.4. Four commits, scoped by concern, plus the P0.8 fixes. They were split
    out of one tree at the end, so each is coherent but was not built in isolation; the commit
    that says so says so.

  - **Criterion 1 — a fresh clone reaches `pnpm dev` in under 10 minutes. Now true: 31 seconds.**
    Measured by cloning into an empty directory and following the README verbatim. install 4 s
    (17 s with a cold pnpm store, measured separately), `db:up` 4 s, migrate+seed 5 s, `pnpm
    check` 18 s. 148 tests. Then `pnpm dev` in the clone: `/api/health` through Vite's proxy
    into workerd returned `{"ok":true,"service":"api"}` and the runner logged
    `claimed:1 succeeded:1 reclaimed:1`. The one unmeasured piece is the `postgres:17-alpine`
    pull on a machine that has never had it; labelled rather than estimated.

  - **The first run of that criterion failed, and it is the same bug P0.7 already fixed.**
    Following the README exactly produced **`67 passed | 14 skipped`, exit 0** — none of the
    job store tested. P0.7 found Turbo 2's strict env mode filtering `DATABASE_URL` and declared
    it on the `test` task. That was correct and insufficient: turbo forwards a variable it can
    see, and **nothing ever put this one in turbo's environment, because nothing loads `.env`.**
    Every layer behaved correctly and the run tested nothing. I had never seen it because I
    always ran `DATABASE_URL=... pnpm check` out of habit.
    - Root `test` script now loads `.env` via `node --env-file-if-exists`, which moves the Node
      floor to **22.9** — cheaper than a dotenv dependency in a repo that has refused every
      gratuitous one.
    - **The durable half: `jobs.pg.test.ts` now fails without a database rather than skipping**,
      unless `SAMSARA_NO_DB=1` says the omission is deliberate. Plumbing fixes hold until the
      next layer appears above them; the actual defect is the silent skip, because a green run
      that means nothing never gets investigated. The opt-out stays, because forbidding it just
      moves people to commenting the test out — it only has to be said out loud, which is the
      bargain `// seam:allow` already strikes.

  - **Criterion 2 — `@live` passes and its session row appears in Postgres. The row half had
    never been implemented.** The test used `MemorySessionStore` *and* `MemoryCounterStore` and
    asserted against the in-memory logger; no row had ever appeared, and it had passed since
    P0.4. The reason it was written that way is good and was applied one noun too far: counters
    must stay in memory or CI spends the demo's allowance on itself, but **a counter is money
    already spent and a session row is a record of something that happened.** The test now
    writes to Postgres when `DATABASE_URL` is set and reads the row back **through SQL**, not
    through the store that wrote it — a store asserting its own return value proves nothing
    about what landed. Budget stays isolated either way.

  - **A real defect the live run found: `Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh` and `Asia/Saigon` are one zone.**
    The test failed on `expected 'Asia/Saigon' to be 'Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh'`. The first is IANA's
    canonical id since 2016, the second the older name kept as a link, and **ICU — what every
    browser and every Node build resolves through — answers with the older one.** The viewpoint
    had landed perfectly: egress `103.252.202.21`, `navigator.language` `vi-VN`, offset −420.
    The assertion was wrong.
    - Not a test nit. **"Did the viewpoint reach the page" is a check every adapter after P1.0
      has to make**, and it decides whether an Observation is interpretable. A false negative is
      the expensive direction — it discards good data and sends someone hunting a proxy bug that
      does not exist. `Asia/Calcutta`/`Asia/Kolkata` is the same trap.
    - `packages/samsara/kernel/src/timezone.ts`: `canonicalTimezoneId` and `sameTimezone`,
      canonicalising **through `Intl` rather than a table we maintain** — aliases move with the
      tzdb and a hand-written map goes stale in silence. 4 tests, including that two zones
      sharing an offset (`Asia/Singapore` vs `Australia/Perth`) stay distinct.
    - **The `sessions` row still stores what we asked for**, which is correct: it records the
      viewpoint requested. What the page reported is a separate fact, and **P1.1 is where a
      persona starts carrying both** — the gap between them is why an Observation can be read.
    - Note the chain: P0.7 moved the engine's fixtures off `Asia/Bangkok` (no alias) onto
      `Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh` (has one) to get the product's first city out of the engine's
      vocabulary. **The seam fix is what exposed this bug.**

  - **Criterion 3 — held, verified both ways again.** Clean tree: `seam ok — 65 files under
    packages/samsara, no travel vocabulary, no travel dependencies.` With `export const
    hotelName` planted in `@samsara/core`: exit 1, naming file, line, the matched word, and the
    three remedies. **Zero allows of five.**

  - **Live spend: 0.1048 minutes across two sessions** (`6596664d` 0.0549, the run that failed
    on the assertion; `e9330835` 0.0499, green). Cumulative across the project: **0.204 of
    4,000 minutes**, 0.005%.

  - **One placeholder closed, one deliberately not.** `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` is now
    `AswinBehera/solari-TravelOS`. The Hyperdrive id is issued by `wrangler hyperdrive create`
    and cannot be invented, so it stays — now with a comment saying it is the one line that must
    change on deploy day, and that nothing local needs it.

  - **Not fixed, recorded: the Postgres tests share a database with `pnpm dev`.**
    `jobs.pg.test.ts` truncates `jobs` before each test, against the same
    `localhost:5432/doen_thang` the dev runner drains. Running `pnpm test` while `pnpm dev` is up
    truncates the dev queue out from under a live worker. Harmless today (the only job type is
    `noop`) and the fix is a separate test database, which is more moving parts than P0.8 should
    add. **Architect's call before P1.2, when harvest jobs start carrying state worth keeping.**

Decisions taken by the executor, for the architect to overrule if wrong:
- Packages are **source-only**: `exports` points at `./src/index.ts`, there is no build step, and
  consumers compile through Vite/tsx. Removes a whole class of stale-dist bug. Revisit if a package
  is ever published.
- `moduleResolution: "Bundler"` with `verbatimModuleSyntax`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, and
  `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` on. The strict flags are cheap now and expensive to add later.
- **`ScoreSet` and `Explanation` live in `@samsara/core`, not `@samsara/refine`.** Section 2.5 puts
  them with the `DomainPack` contract, but `@dt/core`'s `Place.scores` needs them, and making a
  schema package depend on a pipeline package is the wrong shape. `@samsara/refine` will re-export
  them as part of the contract. Flagging because it is a small, deliberate deviation from the plan.
- Nullable over optional throughout, to match what Drizzle returns from Postgres and to keep
  `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` from turning every row read into a conditional.
- **Postgres enums are derived from the Zod enums**, not retyped: `pgEnum("persona_tier",
  personaTier.options)`. A schema and its database type cannot drift if only one of them is
  written down. Costs one `as unknown as` cast at each site, which is worth it.
- **Nested objects are flattened into columns**, not stored as JSON: `stats` becomes
  `stat_sessions`/`stat_minutes`/`stat_blocks`, `engagement` becomes three nullable integers, `geo`
  becomes `lat`/`lng`. These are queried and aggregated; JSON columns would make the budget
  dashboard and the map slower for no gain. Genuinely opaque payloads stay `jsonb`.
- **`@dt/db/src/schema.ts` star-re-exports the engine tables.** Not stylistic: drizzle-kit reads a
  schema file's top-level exports, so exporting only the composed object generated an empty
  migration. Worth knowing before someone "tidies" it.
- **No RLS policies in the migration**, per ADR-0013.
- **No logging library.** pino is the default choice and would have brought a free-form `.info(obj)`
  with it. The logger is ~60 lines of typed events instead, and the public Actions log is the reason.
- **`budget_counters` is a tenth engine table**, not in section 3.1 as written. Section 3.1 has been
  amended. A guard whose counts live in memory forgets them between Worker invocations.
- **The ports pattern**: the kernel depends on `BrowserLauncher`/`SandboxLauncher` interfaces, and
  the SDK is behind `@samsara/kernel/solari`. Every test but the live one runs without a key.
- **Ceilings carry their derivation rate in a comment, never in code** (section 8's rule). Four
  counters for three meters: LLM input and output are priced differently, so they are counted apart.

- **The queue port lives in `@samsara/kernel`** rather than a tenth package, because section 2.1 fixes
  the nine and both apps need it from opposite ends. ADR-0019.
- **The kernel is subdivided by runtime, not by layer**: `./node` holds the only `process`-touching
  file, `./jobs` is runtime-free, and `apps/api` imports those subpaths and never the barrel. Found
  the hard way — source-only packages mean the Workers typechecker compiles the kernel's Node source.
  ADR-0019.
- **`apps/api` typechecks twice** (`tsconfig.json` with `@cloudflare/workers-types` over the source,
  `tsconfig.test.json` with Node's types over the tests), because the source runs on Workers and the
  tests must run on Node to measure CPU at all.
- **`workerd`'s postinstall is allowed to run** (`allowBuilds` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`). It is
  Cloudflare's own runtime binary and wrangler cannot start without it. Flagging it because allowing a
  postinstall script is a supply-chain decision, not a config tweak.
- **There is no `claimed` state.** A state nobody can act on differently is not a state, it is a
  comment. `running` plus `lease_until` carries the same information and is self-healing.
- **`jobs.type` is free text, not an enum.** An enum here would mean the engine's queue knows the
  product's job names, which is the seam.

- **The API listens on 8788, not wrangler's default 8787**, which is commonly occupied by other local
  tooling. Vite's proxy targets `127.0.0.1` rather than `localhost`, because on macOS `localhost`
  resolves to `::1` first, Vite listens on `::1`, and wrangler listens on IPv4 — naming the family
  turns an intermittent proxy failure into a non-event.
- **`apps/api`'s entrypoint exports only its default handler.** A workerd startup rule, not a style
  choice. See the session note above.
- **`apps/web` has no router yet.** ADR-0002 names TanStack Router and it will land with the second
  route (P1.7, the Persona Lab). A router over one route is a dependency with no decision behind it.
- **Hyperdrive's `localConnectionString` is committed in `wrangler.toml`**, pointing at the
  docker-compose database. Those are throwaway credentials, and a dev setup that needs a secret
  before it will start is a dev setup people work around.

- 2026-09-12 (Claude Code) — session 4c

  - **P0.7 done. `tools/check-seam.ts` + `pnpm check:seam` + `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.** 20 tests
    for the tool itself; the real tree passes; a planted `export const hotelName` fails it end to
    end. `turbo run check:seam test:tools` are root tasks with declared `inputs`, so the check
    re-runs only when the engine or the checker changes. `pnpm check` now runs lint, typecheck
    (which gained `tsc -p tools/tsconfig.json`), seam, tool tests, then the workspace tests.

  - **The check found 44 breaches on its first run, against an allowance ceiling of five.** That is
    the finding, not a detail: ADR-0009's ceiling was set before anyone tried to enforce it. Fixing
    it by writing forty `seam:allow` comments would have been switching the check off with extra
    steps. So the rule changed as well as the code — see the P0.7 amendment appended to ADR-0009.

  - **Executor decision: the lexicon is split by ambiguity, not by comment-versus-code.**
    `bangkok`, `tokyo`, `postcard`, `itinerary`, `tourist`, `hotel`, `restaurant` are scanned
    everywhere including comments; `travel`, `trip`, `place`, `flight`, `booking` are scanned in
    code and string literals only. Blanking comments wholesale was the obvious design and it is
    wrong: the worst breach found was `countries.ts` quoting *"plan section 1.4 names Bangkok as the
    first city"* in a comment. String literals stay in scope for both tiers because a prompt is
    code.

  - **Executor decision: a third check the plan did not specify.** The lexicon cannot see
    `import { db } from "@dt/db"` (no forbidden word), and the `package.json` check cannot either
    (source-only packages resolve workspace imports that were never declared). `check-seam.ts`
    scans engine source for `@dt/*` import statements directly. Without it the engine could import
    the whole product with a clean report.

  - **Executor decision: matching is by identifier segment, not word boundary.** `\btravel\b`
    misses `travelPack` and `Asia/Bangkok`; substring matching flags `replace`. Identifiers split
    on case changes and separators, one plural fold, deliberately not a stemmer.

  - **Executor decision: an unused `seam:allow` is an error, and a reason is mandatory.** Otherwise
    allows survive the rename that made them unnecessary and the count against the ceiling stops
    describing anything.

  - **Engine fixtures moved off the product's first city.** `country: "sg"` / `locale: "th-TH"` /
    `timezoneId: "Asia/Bangkok"` became `vn` / `vi-VN` / `Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh` across
    `core/src/fixtures.ts`, `kernel/src/{kernel,registry,live}.test.ts`. Chosen because
    `countries.ts` maps `vn` to the same substitute egress (`sg`) as `th`, so the
    unsupported-country path, the substitution and the viewpoint/egress disagreement are all still
    under test. `idempotencyKey: "trip-42"` -> `"dupe-42"`; the IANA example in `kernel.ts`'s error
    message is no longer a product city; engine comments now name markets by ISO code. 80 kernel
    tests pass against a real Postgres 17 after the rewrite.

  - **The per-package `seam.test.ts` files stay.** They check things the central tool does not
    (exact dependency lists, the provider SDK reachable from exactly one file), and they fail in the
    package that broke the rule. Their `importsTravelScope` identifier was itself a lexicon breach
    and is now `importsProductScope`.

  - **Latent bug found while writing CI: `pnpm test` was silently skipping every Postgres test.**
    Turbo 2 runs tasks in strict env mode, so `DATABASE_URL` never reached vitest no matter what
    the shell exported, and `jobs.pg.test.ts` skipped itself and reported green — 67 passed, 13
    skipped, exit 0. The CI workflow written this session would have claimed to test the job
    store, which is the one component with real concurrency in it, while testing none of it.
    Fixed by declaring `"env": ["DATABASE_URL", "SOLARI_LIVE"]` on the `test` task in
    `turbo.json`. `pnpm test` now runs 80 kernel tests, not 67.

  - **First CI workflow.** `ci.yml`: Postgres 17 service, `pnpm db:migrate`, then lint / typecheck /
    seam / tool tests / tests as **separate named steps**, because the step name is what the PR page
    shows — "seam" failing tells a reader the engine learned a travel word.

  - **Supabase credentials were not needed for P0.7.** They are needed for two things only: running
    an authenticated request against the real JWT path locally (`SUPABASE_URL`), and deploy.

Open for architect before P0.8:
- **Closed 11 September 2026 — ADR-0017. Google is out of the stack.** The quota-cap obligation is
  closed by deletion rather than by doing it: no Google API key is created, so there is nothing to
  cap, and **no vendor in the system can now bill Aswin's card without someone deciding to spend.**
  Resolution is tiered instead — coordinates already in the harvested artifact, then an OSM
  named-POI extract in our own Postgres, then a free-tier hosted geocoder (LocationIQ or Geoapify),
  then `unresolvable`. Not the public Nominatim server: its usage policy caps recurring scripts at
  4 req/min and names systematic querying as grounds for a ban, so the interim plan section 8 was
  carrying was never a safe harbour. Geocoding's ~$5 allocation returns to the reserve, which grows
  to ~$9 and stays reserve. ADR-0018 finishes the job on the map side: the basemap is a Protomaps
  `.pmtiles` extract we host, so there is no tile vendor either.
- **Worth asking Solari: is `th` residential egress on the roadmap?** ADR-0015 works without it, but
  the answer turns a design question back into a scheduling one.
- Section 10 questions 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 are unanswered. None of them block P0.5.
- **P0.5 is unblocked.** Questions 1 and 3 are both answered.
- **Answered: the repository is public.** So Actions minutes are unmetered, section 8 stays at
  three meters, and the Actions log is public — which is why the kernel's logger has no free-form
  field. Question 1 is fully closed.
- **Solari is not under maintenance.** The live call reached them and came back with a structured
  400, which is a healthy provider disagreeing with us.
- **Closed 11 September 2026 — ADR-0016.** The demo topology proposal (GitHub Actions cron + inline
  SSE, deleting BullMQ/Redis/the always-on box) was reviewed cold by Gemini 3.1 Pro via `agy` and
  two holes survived verification: a once-per-second poll behind SSE spends 86,400 of the free
  plan's 100,000 daily Hyperdrive queries **per open tab, account-wide**, and the 5-minute cron
  floor leaves a user-triggered harvest looking dead. Progress is now pushed on state change with a
  bounded backing-off stream; foreground jobs are dispatched via `workflow_dispatch`. Consequence
  for P0.5: the API gains an `actions:write` GitHub token as a Worker secret, and acceptance gains
  a case asserting a bounded query count for a stream held open across a real harvest.

---

## The P1.0 live run — done

Ran 12 September 2026. 18 cells, 20 sessions, **4.790 browser-minutes of 4,000**, zero refusals.
Results in `packages/travel/lab/results/2026-09-12T101036-youtube.search.json`; the table is at the
top of this file and the reading is in
`casestudy_and_thinking/sessions/2026-09-12-p10b-the-result.md`.

```
pnpm --filter @dt/lab signal-matrix:plan            # prints all 18 cells, opens nothing
pnpm --filter @dt/lab signal-matrix:run             # spends browser-minutes
pnpm --filter @dt/lab signal-matrix:report          # the table, from the latest results file
pnpm --filter @dt/lab exec tsx src/signal-matrix/report.ts --k=10   # re-read at another depth
```

Re-reading costs nothing, which was the point of keeping the arithmetic in a package with no
network in it.

|---|---|
| Sessions | 20 (16 design cells + 2 replicates, 2 of them retried) |
| Estimated beforehand | ~9.0 browser-minutes |
| **Actually spent** | **4.790 minutes of 4,000** — 0.12% of the ceiling |
| Clean cell / failed attempt | 0.16 min / **0.77 min** — a failure costs 5x, the deadline must expire |
| Cumulative to date | 4.895 minutes |
| Surface | YouTube search, logged out, top 20 |
| Run order | shuffled, seed `20260912`, recorded in the results file |
| Counters | the real Postgres ones; the run refuses to start without `DATABASE_URL` |
| Output | a JSON results file in `packages/travel/lab/results/`, read by a network-free reporter |

Three things to carry with the number:

1. **The two replicates earned their minute.** The noise floor came back at 21% — repeating one
   cell changes a fifth of its own list. Three of the four factors land within ten points of that,
   so without the control the table would have read as four findings instead of one.
2. **The answer is YouTube's answer.** One surface, one query, one day. The `Surface` interface
   exists so a second surface costs a file rather than a rewrite.
3. **Nothing was refused** — no consent wall, no captcha, from either egress. Two cells failed
   `internal` and recovered on retry. The refusal path is written and untested against a real
   refusal, which is worth remembering when P1.4 points this at TikTok.

## The Phase 0 gate

Per PLAN §5: *"Aswin reviews the kernel interface, the `DomainPack` contract, and ADRs 0009 to
0014. Nothing else."* All three acceptance criteria are met and measured above. What follows is
what the gate needs to look at, and the three places where the executor deviated or stopped
short on purpose.

**1. The kernel interface** — `packages/samsara/kernel/src/{ports,kernel,result}.ts`.
`withBrowser(purpose, viewpoint, fn)` refuses on the budget guard before anything opens, races a
hard deadline, force-closes on overrun, closes in a `finally`, and meters the minutes actually
taken whether or not the operation succeeded. Failures are classified
`budget | blocked | timeout | upstream | config | internal`; only `upstream` and `internal`
retry. `ports.ts` defines `BrowserLauncher`/`SandboxLauncher` and `solari.ts` is the only file
in the repository that imports the provider SDK. **The question for the gate:** the viewpoint is
`{ country, locale, timezoneId }` today. P1.1 adds stored preferences and a warmed profile.
Is `Viewpoint` the right name and the right shape to grow, or should it be a persona reference
from the start?

**2. The `DomainPack` contract** — `packages/samsara/refine/src/pack.ts`. **Only the identity
half exists** (`id`, `version`) plus `PackRegistry`, and this is the deviation most worth
overruling if it is wrong. PLAN §2.5 specifies `extract`, `entity`, `resolve`, `dedupKeys`,
`score`, `sources`, `queries`; writing those now would mean inventing `RawItem` batching,
`EntityRepo` and `ScoreSet` plumbing against no caller, and the first real pack would be shaped
by guesses rather than correcting them. What P0.5 needed was narrower and is real: a typed
registry the worker holds at boot with **zero packs in it** — the assertion that the runner has
no vertical compiled into it. `DomainPack` is already the exported name, so widening it at P2.2
is one file rather than every consumer. **The question:** accept the deferral, or is there a
member whose shape must be fixed now because something in P1 will otherwise be built against
the wrong assumption?

**4. ADR-0015's signal ordering, now that it has been measured** — new, and the only gate item
with data behind it. The ADR orders the stack: account region, query language, stored preferences,
browser locale and clock, engagement history, egress IP last. P1.0 measured the middle four of
those on a logged-out surface and found **a cliff, not a list**: query language at 100%, then
egress 31%, locale 23%, stored region 20%, against a noise floor of 21%. Three of the four are
within ten points of noise, and egress — which the ADR puts last — sits at the *top* of that weak
cluster rather than the bottom. **The question:** amend ADR-0015 to say the stack is one dominant
signal plus a flat remainder (which makes the missing Thai egress a non-issue and reshapes
P1.3–P1.6 around query construction), or treat one surface on one day as too thin to amend a
decision on and re-run against a second surface first? A second surface costs a file and about
five minutes.

**5. ADRs 0009 to 0014**, plus the four written since:
- **0009 seam** — with the P0.7 amendment: the allowance ceiling was set before anyone tried to
  enforce it; 44 breaches, all fixed by rewriting, zero allows used.
- **0010 domain pack** — see the deferral above.
- **0011 OS is product language**, **0012 OpenRouter**, **0013 Supabase Auth** (no RLS in v1),
  **0014 Cloudflare + GitHub Actions** (the one that deleted BullMQ, Redis and the always-on box).
- Since: **0015 viewpoint over egress**, **0016 progress streaming and job dispatch**,
  **0017 place resolution without Google**, **0018 Protomaps basemap**, **0019 kernel owns the
  queue and splits by runtime**.

**Open questions**, unchanged from last session. None of them blocked P1.0 and none block P1.1:
- Section 10 questions 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 are unanswered.
- Whether to ask Solari about `th` residential egress on their roadmap. ADR-0015 works without
  it; the answer turns a design question back into a scheduling one.
- The shared test/dev database, noted above.

**Nothing is deployed, and nothing can be until two things exist:** a Cloudflare account (for the
Hyperdrive id) and Supabase credentials (`SUPABASE_URL` for the real JWT path). Neither blocks
any local work.
