# Samsara and Doen Thang: Build Plan v2

**Role of this document:** the architect's brief. Aswin owns product and architecture decisions. Claude Code and `agy` (Gemini) execute tasks from this plan across sessions. Executors do not re-plan; they build what a task says, report back, and raise questions in the designated file.

**Status:** v2, 11 September 2026. Repo is a fresh fork of the Solari cookbook with no product code yet.

**What changed in v2.** Two corrections to v1, both structural.

1. **We are not building an operating system.** We are building a *service layer* over Solari's infrastructure: session orchestration, budgets, deadlines, scheduled processes, and a pipeline. Solari is the hardware and the drivers. "OS" remains the product-facing metaphor for Doen Thang, and it is earned only to the degree that the daemons, personas, and executable Postcards are real. It is not a description of the architecture, and executors should never reason about the code as if it were one. See section 1.5.

2. **The service layer is domain-agnostic and has a name: Samsara.** The horizontal primitive underneath Doen Thang is *situated observation*: seeing the internet exactly as a specific kind of person in a specific place sees it, at scale, repeatedly, and turning that into structured evidence. Personas are incarnations; Samsara is the machinery that runs them. Travel is vertical one, not the substrate. Section 1.6 defines the seam, and section 2.5 defines the contract a vertical implements. **The seam is enforced in CI, not in comments.**

## 0. How to use this document (read this first, every session)

This plan lives at `docs/PLAN.md` in the repo. Three companion files:

| File | Purpose | Who writes |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/PLAN.md` | This document. Product, architecture, phases, tasks. | Architect only |
| `docs/STATUS.md` | Current phase, last completed task, next task, known breakage. | Executor, at the end of every session |
| `docs/QUESTIONS.md` | Anything the spec doesn't answer. Executor writes, architect answers inline. | Both |
| `docs/adr/NNNN-title.md` | Architecture decision records. One file per decision. | Architect proposes, executor records |

### Session protocol for executors

Paste this at the top of every Claude Code or Gemini session:

```
You are the code executor for Doen Thang. Read docs/PLAN.md, then docs/STATUS.md,
then docs/QUESTIONS.md. Do exactly one task from the current phase, the one marked
NEXT in STATUS.md. Definition of done is in PLAN.md section 0. When finished, update
STATUS.md (what you did, what you touched, what is NEXT, anything broken). If the task
is underspecified, write the question in QUESTIONS.md and stop. Do not expand scope.
Do not refactor code outside the task. Do not add dependencies not listed in PLAN.md
section 4 without writing a QUESTIONS.md entry first.

Hard architectural rule: packages under packages/samsara/ are domain-agnostic. They may
not contain travel vocabulary or import any @dt/* package. Travel lives in the places
PLAN.md section 1.6 lists, and nowhere else. Run `pnpm check:seam` before you report done.
```

### Definition of done for any task

1. Code compiles, typecheck passes (`pnpm typecheck`), lint passes.
2. Unit tests exist for pure logic (parsers, scorers, dedup). Integration tests that hit Solari are tagged `@live` and skipped in CI.
3. Any Solari session opened is closed in a `finally`. Any sandbox is `kill()`ed, not `close()`d.
4. `STATUS.md` updated. If a decision was made that the plan didn't cover, an ADR exists.
5. No secrets in the repo. `.env.example` updated if a new variable was introduced.
6. `pnpm check:seam` passes. No package under `packages/samsara/` gained a travel word or a `@dt/*` import. See section 1.6.

### Division of labour between executors

Either executor can do any task. Practical split that has worked elsewhere:

- **Claude Code:** Samsara packages, Solari integration, scheduler, data model, the domain-pack contract, anything where correctness matters more than speed.
- **`agy` (Gemini Pro):** frontend iteration, UI polish, copy, design-system components, adapter parsers against saved fixtures, exploratory prototypes.

Invoke the second executor as `agy --model <gemini-pro-id> -p "<task>"` from the repo root, or interactively with `agy -i`. Give it the same session protocol block.

Hard rule: never run two executors on the same package at the same time. If parallel, use separate branches named `exec/<package>/<task-id>`.

### Escalate to the architect when

- A task would require violating a non-goal (section 1.3).
- A scraping target blocks you after two adapter strategies.
- Solari spend for a single task exceeds the budget in section 8.
- The data model needs a new entity.

---

## 1. Product definition

### 1.1 One line

**Doen Thang** is a Travel OS: it runs background processes on your behalf (watching prices, living inside local feeds, resolving places) and hands you the results as executable Postcards inside a trip document you just type into.

**Samsara** is what actually runs underneath: a service layer over Solari that maintains situated personas, harvests what they see, refines it into structured evidence, and probes any URL from any country on a schedule. Doen Thang is the first thing built on it. It should not be the last.

### 1.2 The three pillars, ranked by build priority

| Priority | Pillar | Internal name | What it is | Why this rank |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Discovery | **Persona Lab** + **Harvest** | Locally situated browser personas read regional feeds; a pipeline turns what they see into structured, geocoded Places with evidence. | The only pillar with no direct competitor and the only one that produces a demo nobody else can make (tourist feed vs local feed, side by side). |
| 2 | Retention | **Trip Document** + **Postcards** | A dynamic document (type like a journal) whose blocks are typed, geo-aware Postcards. Map and timeline are derived views, not separate tools. | Where the harvested places land. Without it, Discovery is a feed with nowhere to go. |
| 3 | Hook | **Hundred Eyes** | Price observatory: one URL, N countries, one table of what each locale is shown. | Cheap to build once Solari wrapper exists. Great marketing. Deliberately scoped to observation only (see non-goals). |
| Later | Execution | **Agents** | Sandbox agents that act on a Postcard (book a train, hold a table). | High value, high liability, needs the first three to exist. |

### 1.3 Non-goals for v1 (these are decisions, not omissions)

- **No purchase routing through proxies.** Hundred Eyes shows price discrimination; it never completes a transaction on a foreign locale. Billing-address mismatch, ToS exposure, and denied-boarding risk make this a liability we don't want. Revisit only with a partner that can legally issue localized payment.
- **No auto-posting to the user's Instagram/TikTok.** Logging into users' social accounts from cloud browsers is an account-ban and trust problem. Export a scrapbook page instead; let them post it.
- **No logged-in persona farming in Phase 1.** Tier 1 harvest uses logged-out surfaces only. Seeded, logged-in personas are Phase 5 and gated on legal review.
- **No infinite canvas.** The document is linear text with rich blocks. Spatial views are derived.
- **No mobile native app.** Responsive web. A PWA wrapper is acceptable in Phase 6.
- **No multiplayer editing in v1.** Single-owner documents with share links. Yjs later.

### 1.4 First user, first city

- **First city:** Bangkok. Reason: brand alignment, Thai-language content is abundant on TikTok/YouTube, strong local forum culture (Pantip), and hostile-enough anti-bot posture to prove the pipeline without being the hardest target.
- **Answered by ADR-0015: Bangkok stays, and the Thai IP was never the load-bearing part.** Platforms
  rank by a stack of signals — account region, query language, stored region preference, browser
  locale and timezone, engagement history, and only then the egress IP. A persona that asks in Thai,
  from a `th-TH` browser on `Asia/Bangkok`, with Thai regional parameters and a warmed profile, is
  closer to a Bangkok viewpoint than a Thai IP asking in English would be. Egress is one ingredient
  and the weakest; Singapore supplies it, one hour and 1,400km away, labelled as what it is.
- **The finding that forced this, from P0.4: Solari has no Thai residential egress.** A live launch with `country: "th"` returns `400 Unsupported proxy country`; the pool is `au br ca de es fr gb in it jp kr mx nl sg us` (read 11 September 2026, recorded in `packages/samsara/kernel/src/countries.ts`). A Bangkok persona therefore cannot browse from a Thai IP today. The kernel refuses `th` locally and names `sg` as nearest, but **never substitutes it** — a silent country swap would change what a persona sees, which is the one variable the Persona Lab exists to hold still. This is question 9 in section 10 and is Aswin's call, not the kernel's.
- **First user:** an English-speaking traveller with 2 to 6 weeks before a Bangkok trip, who already saves TikToks and screenshots and has nowhere to put them. Not the backpacker on a shoestring; the person who would pay $8/month to not eat at a tourist trap.
- **Second city (Phase 6 validation):** Tokyo. Different script, different platforms (Tabelog), proves the adapter model generalises.

### 1.5 What "OS" means here, honestly

Doen Thang is a service layer, not an operating system. Solari supplies the isolated machines, the proxies, and the profile storage; Samsara supplies scheduling, budgets, deadlines, and a pipeline; Doen Thang supplies a document. No process table, no memory manager, no syscall boundary. Anyone reading the code should read it as an orchestration layer over a compute API, because that is what it is.

The metaphor still earns its place in the **product**, and we keep it there: the UI says TRAVEL OS, the ops view is `/kernel`, loading states name the daemon that is running. That is honest exactly as long as the daemons are real — background work that continues when the tab is closed, personas with persistent state, Postcards that do something when clicked. The day those become a landing page, the word becomes a lie and we drop it.

So the table below is a **product** rubric, not an architecture diagram. Use it to decide what belongs in v1:

| Metaphor | Doen Thang implementation | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| Kernel | Session orchestrator over Solari: allocates browsers/sandboxes, enforces budgets, kills strays | `apps/worker` + `@samsara/kernel` |
| Processes | Long-running jobs: persona keepalive, harvest runs, price watchers | Rows in a `jobs` table, drained by a scheduled runner |
| Filesystem | Trip documents and typed Postcards with metadata | Postgres, `@dt/core` schemas |
| Syscalls | Postcard actions (`refresh`, `watch`, `resolve`, later `execute`) that dispatch to the orchestrator | `apps/api` |
| Users / context switch | Persona selection: "tourist view" vs "local view" swaps which personas harvest | `@samsara/personas` |
| Daemons | Scheduled keepalive and watcher ticks | GitHub Actions cron, enqueuing the next tick |

If a feature request doesn't map to one of these rows, it's an app feature, not an OS feature, and it goes to the backlog.

### 1.6 Samsara: the horizontal layer and the seam

**The primitive.** Situated observation. Give Samsara an identity (country, locale, optional persisted browser profile) and a target (a query on a platform, or a URL), and it returns what that identity was actually shown, with evidence, repeatably, on a schedule, under a budget. Everything Doen Thang does is that primitive plus a travel-shaped interpretation of the results.

**Why it matters commercially.** The same engine, with a different domain pack, does algorithm auditing (what does TikTok show a teenager in Jakarta versus Lyon), geo-pricing intelligence, localised SERP and ad monitoring, in-language market research, and diaspora feeds. Most of those are B2B and pay 50 to 500 times what a traveller pays for a Pro plan. We are not building them now — platforms without a wedge die quietly — but we refuse to make them expensive later.

**The rule.** Exactly four kinds of thing are allowed to know the word "travel":

| Allowed to know about travel | Not allowed, ever |
|---|---|
| `packages/travel/pack/**` — the domain pack: entity schema, prompts, resolver, dedup keys, scoring weights, query sets, city configs | `packages/samsara/**` — every engine package |
| `packages/travel/core/**`, `packages/travel/db/**` — Trip, Document, Postcard, and their tables | Any engine Zod schema, DB column, queue name, or log field |
| `packages/travel/ui/**` — Postcards, map, timeline, design system | Any engine prompt file |
| `apps/web/**` — the entire travel UI | `apps/api` and `apps/worker` route/queue *plumbing* (they wire packs in, they don't hardcode one) |

**How it is enforced.** Two mechanical checks in `pnpm check:seam`, run in CI and in the definition of done:

1. **Lexicon check.** Fail if any file under `packages/samsara/**` matches a word-boundary hit on a forbidden list: `travel`, `trip`, `place` (as an identifier), `postcard`, `hotel`, `flight`, `itinerary`, `tourist`, `bangkok`, `tokyo`, `restaurant`, `booking`. Escape hatch: a line-level `// seam:allow <reason>` comment, which the check counts and prints. If the allow-count climbs above five, the seam is wrong and we redesign it rather than adding a sixth.
2. **Dependency direction check.** Fail if any `packages/samsara/*/package.json` lists a `@dt/*` dependency. The arrow points one way: travel depends on Samsara, never the reverse.

Source adapters are the subtle case and the rule is: **adapters are per-source, not per-domain.** A TikTok adapter, a Google Maps reviews adapter, a Booking.com price adapter are all horizontal — algorithm auditors and pricing analysts want exactly the same ones. They live in `@samsara/sources`. What is travel-specific is *which queries we run, in which city, and what we conclude from the results*, and that is the domain pack.

**When to break the seam.** When holding it would cost more than a week of travel-product progress. In that case: write an ADR saying what leaked and what it would take to clean up, get Aswin's sign-off, and proceed. The seam exists to keep the second vertical cheap, not to be a religion.

---

## 2. Architecture

### 2.1 Monorepo layout

Two scopes, one repo. `@samsara/*` is the domain-agnostic service layer; `@dt/*` is travel. The directory split is what the seam check keys on, so it is load-bearing, not cosmetic.

```
doen-thang/
  apps/
    web/                  React + Vite + TS. TanStack Router + Query. Tailwind. Travel UI. @dt scope.
    api/                  Hono on Node 22. REST + SSE. Auth middleware. Thin: validates, enqueues, reads.
    worker/               Scheduled runner: claims jobs, drains, exits. All Solari sessions are opened here and only here.
  packages/

      db/                 @samsara/db       Drizzle schema for engine tables. Exports schema; owns no migrations.
      kernel/             @samsara/kernel   Solari wrapper: session registry, budget guard, deadlines, retry, logs.
      personas/           @samsara/personas Persona lifecycle: create, seed, keepalive, health, ban detection.
      sources/            @samsara/sources  Source adapters, one folder per source. Per-source, not per-domain.
      harvest/            @samsara/harvest  Run orchestration: persona x source x query -> RawItem[].

      probe/              @samsara/probe    Locale probe: one URL x N countries -> Observation[]. Hundred Eyes' engine.
      llm/                @samsara/llm      Provider-agnostic interface. OpenRouter by default. Model is config, not code. Engine prompts only.
    travel/               ---- vertical one. Everything here may know it is about travel. ----

  examples/               Keep the Solari cookbook examples as reference. Do not import from them.
```

Tooling: pnpm workspaces, Turborepo for task graph, Biome for lint/format, Vitest, tsx for scripts.

Two consequences worth stating plainly, because they are where the seam usually breaks:

- **`apps/api` and `apps/worker` wire packs in; they do not hardcode one.** A queue is `refine.run` carrying a `domainId`, not `refine.places`. A route is `/entities/:domainId/...` or it is a travel route that calls a generic service. Today there is one pack registered and that is fine; the registry still exists.
- **`@dt/db` owns the single migration history.** `@samsara/db` exports Drizzle table definitions and nothing else. One Postgres, one `migrations/` folder, no cross-package migration ordering problem. If Samsara is ever extracted to its own repo, that folder splits then, not now.

### 2.2 Runtime topology

Revised by ADR-0014. There is no always-on box and no Redis: a fixed monthly hosting fee competes directly with the browser minutes that produce the demo's actual output.

```
Browser (web)                      GitHub Actions (scheduled)
      |                                      |
      | HTTPS                                | wakes, claims jobs, drains, exits
      v                                      v
  api (Hono on Cloudflare Workers)       worker (Node)
      |                                      |
      |  Hyperdrive                          |  jobs table:
      v                                      v  SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
                    Postgres (Supabase)  <-------------------  Solari API
                            ^                                  (browsers, sandboxes)
                            |
                    Object storage (Supabase Storage): screenshots, session recordings, thumbnails
```

Rules that follow from this:

- **Only `apps/worker` talks to Solari.** The API never opens a browser. This keeps sessions in one process with one registry and one budget guard.
- **`apps/web` and `apps/api` are on Cloudflare's free plan; `apps/worker` is a scheduled GitHub Actions job.** The deciding limit is CPU, not duration: free Workers allow 10 ms of CPU per invocation, which a thin API can meet and a parser cannot. See ADR-0014.
- **`apps/api` must stay genuinely thin**, and the platform now enforces that rather than leaving it to discipline. P0.5 measures CPU per request and records the number. The fallback if it does not fit is Supabase Edge Functions, not a paid plan.
- **The queue is a Postgres table, not Redis.** A queue exists to hand work to an always-on consumer; once the consumer wakes on a schedule and exits, the table is enough.
- **Every job is idempotent and resumable.** A scheduled runner can be cancelled mid-flight. Jobs claim rows under a lease, and an expired lease is reclaimable. This is stricter than BullMQ needed, and it is the real cost of ADR-0014.
- **Every Solari session gets a row in `sessions`** with purpose, owner (user or system), started/ended, minutes, cost estimate. This is how we know what the OS is doing and what it costs.

### 2.3 Solari usage patterns (from the cookbook, verified)

Two packages: `@solarisdk/browser` (cloud browser, Playwright-compatible pages) and `@solarisdk/sdk` (`SolariClient`, sandboxes, desktops).

```ts
// Browser: stealth is required for proxy and captcha.
const browser = await solari.launch({
  stealth: true,
  proxy: { country: "th" },                       // or { country: "th", tier: "mobile" }
  // proxy: { country: "th", session: "bkk-p01" } // sticky IP for a persona
  // captcha: true,
  profileId,                                       // optional persisted persona
})
// Profiles persist cookies + localStorage server-side. Saving is explicit:
const state = await page.context().storageState()
await solari.profiles.save(profile.id, state)
// Always: browser.close() in finally; solari.close() at process shutdown.

// Sandbox: argv, not shell. kill(), not close().
const sb = await pt.sandboxes.create({ template: "base", timeoutMs: 5 * 60_000 })
await sb.commands.run("sh", { args: ["-c", "..."] })
await sb.kill()
```

Gotchas the executor must encode in `@samsara/kernel`:

- `timeoutMs` is a rolling idle window, not a deadline. The kernel enforces its own hard deadline per session purpose (default 4 minutes for harvest, 90 seconds for a price probe).
- Session recording is opt-in per session (`recording: true`). Turn it on for the first N runs of any new adapter, off by default in production.
- `proxy` and `captcha` both require `stealth: true`. The kernel should refuse a config that violates this rather than let Solari reject it.
- Pin `@solarisdk/browser` to a known version. Check the changelog (changelog.getsolari.com) before bumping.

### 2.4 The kernel (`@samsara/kernel`)

Responsibilities, in priority order:

1. **Session registry.** In-memory map plus a DB row per session. On worker boot, reconcile: any session marked open in the DB with no live handle gets logged as orphaned.
2. **Budget guard. Three meters, not one.** Solari minutes are the cheapest thing this system spends; LLM tokens and geocoding calls are the two that can actually overrun the ceiling. A guard that counts only minutes is theatre. Each meter has a hard ceiling expressed as a **count, not dollars** — no FX or rate-drift guesswork at runtime — and exhausting any one refuses the operation that would spend it, loudly, with the meter named in the error. Within the minutes meter the three windows still apply: global per day, per-user per day, per-purpose per run. Counters are rows in Postgres, keyed by meter and window — ADR-0014 removed Redis, and a budget guard that forgets what it spent when a runner exits is not a guard. The ceilings are constants in one file, each carrying the rate it was derived from in a comment beside it (see section 8). All three meters appear on the `/kernel` screen from the day that screen exists.
3. **Hard deadline.** `withSession(purpose, opts, fn)` wraps every launch with a timeout that force-closes the browser. `fn` never gets a raw browser without this wrapper.
4. **Retry policy.** Retry on network/launch errors up to 2 times with jitter. Never retry on block/captcha-failed; surface as a `Blocked` result so the adapter can try its next strategy.
5. **Structured logs.** One JSON line per session lifecycle event with purpose, persona, country, duration, outcome, bytes.

Interface sketch:

```ts
type SessionPurpose = "persona.seed" | "persona.keepalive" | "harvest" | "probe" | "agent"
withBrowser<T>(purpose, { country, personaId?, recording?, deadlineMs? }, fn: (page) => Promise<T>): Promise<Result<T, Blocked | Timeout | Error>>
withSandbox<T>(purpose, { template, deadlineMs }, fn): Promise<Result<T>>
```

Note `SessionPurpose` is a closed union of *engine* purposes. It does not gain a member when a vertical is added; a vertical's work is a `harvest` or a `probe`, tagged with its `domainId` in the session row.

---

### 2.5 The domain pack (`@samsara/refine`)

This is the contract that makes Samsara agnostic, and the single most important interface in the repo. The pipeline machinery — batching, LLM calls, retry, caching, merge, explanation capture, job chaining — is generic and lives in `@samsara/refine`. Everything that knows what an entity *is* lives in a pack.

```ts
// @samsara/refine — the contract. No travel words appear in this file.
export interface DomainPack<TMention, TEntity> {
  id: string                      // "travel". Stamped on every Mention, Evidence, and Session row.
  version: string                 // Bump when prompts or weights change; stored with each Evidence row.

  extract: {
    mentionSchema: ZodType<TMention>          // what the LLM must return per raw item
    prompt: PromptRef                         // versioned prompt file, lives in the pack
    batchBy: (item: RawItem) => string        // e.g. group by detected language
  }

  entity: {
    schema: ZodType<TEntity>
    repo: EntityRepo<TEntity>                 // pack owns its own table; engine never writes it directly
  }

  resolve(m: TMention, ctx: ResolveCtx): Promise<Resolution<TEntity>>   // mention -> real-world entity
  dedupKeys(e: TEntity): DedupKey[]                                     // ordered: strongest key first
  score(e: TEntity, ev: Evidence[]): ScoreSet                           // named scores, each explainable
  sources: SourceId[]                                                   // which @samsara/sources adapters to run
  queries(ctx: QueryCtx): HarvestQuery[]                                // what to ask, from which personas
}

type DedupKey  = { kind: "exact" | "fuzzy" | "geo" | "embedding"; value: string; radiusM?: number }
type ScoreSet  = Record<string, { value: number; because: Explanation[] }>
type Explanation = { factor: string; contribution: number; evidenceIds: string[] }
```

Design notes the executor must honour:

- **A pack is a plain object, not a plugin system.** No dynamic loading, no manifest format, no sandbox. It is imported and passed to the pipeline at worker boot. Registration is a `Map<string, DomainPack>` in `apps/worker`.
- **`ScoreSet` carries its own explanation.** Product principle 3 ("show the algorithm") is therefore satisfied generically: any UI can render why a score is what it is, for any vertical, without the engine knowing what the score means. `localScore` is a travel word; `scores.local` is a key in a generic map.
- **`repo` inverts ownership.** The engine calls `repo.upsert`, `repo.findByKeys`, `repo.merge`. The `places` table is defined in `@dt/db` and the engine never imports it.
- **Anything a pack needs that the engine can't give it is a missing engine capability,** not a reason to reach across the seam. Write it in QUESTIONS.md.

---

## 3. Data model

Entities are listed with the fields that matter for design. Executors add timestamps, ids, and indexes as standard.

One Postgres, one migration history, two schema modules. **An engine table never holds a foreign key to a travel table.** Where the engine must point at a domain entity it stores an opaque pair `(domainId, entityId)` with no FK constraint, and the pack's `repo` resolves it. Travel tables may point at engine tables freely.

### 3.1 Engine tables (`@samsara/core` + `@samsara/db`)

No travel vocabulary appears in this subsection. That is the test.

**Persona**: id, name, locality (free text: the city or region this identity reads as being in), country (proxy country), locale, tier (`anon` | `seeded`), solariProfileId?, proxySession? (sticky IP key), health (`healthy` | `degraded` | `banned` | `retired`), seedPlanId?, lastAliveAt, stats (sessions, minutes, blocks).

**SeedPlan**: id, locality, steps[] (ordered: visit URL, dwell seconds, scroll, search term). Versioned so we can compare persona drift across plans.

**Session**: id, purpose, ownerId? (opaque; the engine does not know what a user is), domainId?, personaId?, country, startedAt, endedAt, minutes, outcome, recordingRef?.

**HarvestRun**: id, domainId, personaId, sourceId, query, startedAt, endedAt, outcome, itemCount, sessionId.

**RawItem**: id, harvestRunId, sourceId, url, title, text, languageGuess, mediaRefs[], engagement (views, likes, comments, nullable), capturedAt, rawRef (object storage key). The unit a source adapter produces; the unit `extract` consumes.

**Mention**: id, rawItemId, domainId, packVersion, payload (JSON, validated against the pack's `mentionSchema`), entityId? (null until resolved), resolution (`pending` | `resolved` | `unresolvable`), confidence.

**Evidence**: id, domainId, entityId (opaque, no FK — see section 3 preamble), rawItemId, sourceId, sourceUrl, personaId, language, capturedAt, extract (JSON, pack-shaped), rawRef, engagement.

**ProbeTarget**: id, ownerId?, sourceId, url, parsed (JSON, shape declared by the source adapter), watch (boolean), cadence.

**Observation**: id, targetId, country, personaId?, capturedAt, payload (JSON, shape declared by the source adapter), screenshotRef, sessionId, notes. Generic on purpose: a price is one payload shape, a ranked SERP is another, a rendered ad slot is a third. The probe engine does not know which.

**BudgetCounter**: id, meter (`solari.minutes` | `llm.input.tokens` | `llm.output.tokens` | `geocode.calls`), window (`global.day` | `owner.day` | `purpose.run`), windowKey (the day, owner, or run the count belongs to), amount. Unique on (meter, window, windowKey), incremented atomically. Added in P0.4 rather than listed here from the start: section 2.4 describes a three-metered guard, and a guard that holds its counts in memory is a guard that forgets them between a Worker invocation and the next. Four counters, three meters — LLM input and output are priced differently and so are counted separately.

### 3.2 Travel tables (`@dt/core` + `@dt/db`)

**User**: id, email, plan (`free` | `pro`), locale, budget overrides. Auth and billing are app concerns; the engine only ever sees `ownerId: string`.

**Trip**: id, userId, title, destinationCity (canonical), startDate, endDate, status (`dreaming` | `planning` | `travelling` | `done`).

**Document**: id, tripId, content (Tiptap/ProseMirror JSON), version. One document per trip in v1.

**Postcard**: id, tripId, kind (`place` | `price` | `note` | `photo` | `link` | `checklist`), placeId?, payload (kind-specific JSON), geo (lat/lng, nullable), time (date or range, nullable), sourceRefs (Evidence ids), state (`fresh` | `stale` | `pinned`). A Postcard is the only thing that appears on the map. If it has no geo, it doesn't.

**Place**: id, canonicalName, localName (native script), city, geo, externalRef? (`{ source: 'osm' | 'geocoder' | 'artifact', id: string }` — ADR-0017 replaced `googlePlaceId` with a source-tagged reference, because the resolver is now tiered and the winning tier has to be recoverable), resolvedTier? (0-3), category (`food` | `drink` | `market` | `temple` | `nature` | `nightlife` | `shop` | `other`), tags[], scores (JSON `ScoreSet`: `local` and `tourist`, each with a value 0 to 1 and its `because` explanations), firstSeenAt, lastSeenAt, evidenceCount. Written only through `@dt/travel-pack`'s `EntityRepo`.

There is no `PriceTarget` or `PriceObservation` table. Travel reads `ProbeTarget` and `Observation` filtered to `sourceId in (booking, agoda)` and renders them as Price Postcards. If that proves awkward in Phase 3, a travel-side view is acceptable; a duplicate table is not.

## 4. Stack decisions (ADR-0001 through ADR-0014, executor records these on Phase 0)

| # | Decision | Choice | Reason | Swap point |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0001 | Language | TypeScript everywhere | One language for executors, Solari's primary SDK is TS | None |
| 0002 | Web | React + Vite, TanStack Router/Query, Tailwind | Aswin's existing fluency (Solitary Reaper stack). No SSR needed for an app behind auth. | Next.js if SEO landing pages need to live in the same app; they don't, landing goes on Astro |
| 0003 | API | Hono on Node 22 | Small, typed, fast, runs anywhere | Fastify if plugin ecosystem needed |
| 0004 | Jobs | ~~BullMQ on Redis~~ — superseded by ADR-0014. A `jobs` table in Postgres, claimed with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` by a scheduled GitHub Actions runner. | A queue serves an always-on consumer. ADR-0014 removed the always-on consumer, so the queue went with it — one fewer vendor, one fewer line item | BullMQ on Upstash if a job ever needs sub-minute latency or fan-out that a scheduled drain cannot give |
| 0005 | DB | Postgres on Supabase with Drizzle | Auth + Postgres + storage from one vendor cuts Phase 0 time; Drizzle keeps schema in TS | Neon + Clerk if Supabase auth chafes |
| 0006 | LLM | Provider-agnostic `@samsara/llm`. Superseded in part by ADR-0012: the default route is OpenRouter, not a direct Anthropic key. | Extraction is high-volume, so cost dominates model preference | Any provider behind the interface |
| 0007 | Geocoding | ~~Google Places API (Text Search + Details) with Nominatim fallback~~ — superseded by ADR-0017 | Premise was a discovery problem; discovery happens in the harvest | — |
| 0008 | Maps (UI) | MapLibre GL with a styled vector basemap. Tile source settled by ADR-0018 | Free, styleable to the brand palette, no Google Maps branding in the UI | Leaflet if MapLibre is overkill (Aswin has Leaflet experience from the ARG) |
| 0009 | Layer split | Two scopes in one repo: `@samsara/*` service layer, `@dt/*` travel vertical, seam enforced by `pnpm check:seam` | Keeps the second vertical cheap without paying two-repo tax before there is a second vertical | Extract `packages/samsara/` to its own repo when a paying non-travel use case exists. Directory layout is chosen so this is a `git filter-repo`, not a refactor |
| 0010 | Verticals | Domain pack: a plain TS object implementing `DomainPack` (section 2.5), registered in a Map at worker boot | Plugin systems are a tax paid up front for flexibility we don't need yet; a typed object gets 90% of the benefit for none of the cost | A real plugin host with dynamic loading, if third parties ever write packs |
| 0011 | Naming | "OS" is product-facing language for Doen Thang only. Code, schemas, logs, and docs say service layer, orchestrator, pipeline | Honest architecture beats a flattering metaphor in the place where correctness matters; the metaphor still earns its keep in the UI | Drop the metaphor from the product too, if the daemons stop being real |
| 0014 | Hosting | Cloudflare Workers (free) for `apps/web` and `apps/api`; GitHub Actions scheduled workflow for `apps/worker`; no Redis | Free Workers meter CPU, not wall clock, at 10 ms per invocation — fine for a thin API, impossible for a parser. A free runner beats $5/month out of a $20 budget | Workers Paid ($5/mo) for a 30s cron CPU ceiling, or Fly.io, if the demo becomes a product with revenue |
| 0013 | Auth | Supabase Auth. `apps/api` verifies the JWT and uses `sub` as `ownerId`; the travel `users` table keys on that id. No RLS in v1 — authorisation lives in the API layer, because the worker writes for users who are not present. | One vendor already holds Postgres and storage; a second auth vendor buys better components at the cost of a second id space, for a requirement that is "email in, JWT out" | Neon + Clerk, per ADR-0005's swap point. The seam keeps auth entirely above the engine, so the move stays cheap |
| 0012 | LLM routing | OpenRouter as the single LLM gateway. One key, many models. The model for each task is an env var, never a literal in code. | Under a $20 ceiling the extraction model must be chosen by measurement, not by preference — and swapping it must cost nothing. Replaying stored RawItems is free on the Solari meter, so the bake-off is cheap. | A direct provider key, if OpenRouter's markup or a rate limit ever exceeds the cost of the vendor sprawl it removes |
| 0015 | Viewpoint | A session's viewpoint (locale, timezone, geolocation) is set by us and is independent of the proxy country. The kernel builds its own browser context; the provider sets neither | Platforms rank local content from a signal stack in which the egress IP is the last and weakest term. Solari carries no `th` egress and has none planned, so the viewpoint has to carry the weight | Residential `th` egress, if a provider ever offers it — it would strengthen the stack, not replace it |
| 0018 | Basemap | A single Protomaps `.pmtiles` extract on Cloudflare static assets or R2, read by MapLibre over range requests. Amends ADR-0008 | Removes the last map vendor: no tile server, no key, no quota a public demo can exhaust | MapTiler or Stadia free tiers, if hosting the extract proves fiddlier than it looks |
| 0017 | Place resolution | Tiered and Google-free: coordinates already in the harvested artifact, then an OSM named-POI extract in our own Postgres, then a free-tier hosted geocoder, then `unresolvable`. Supersedes ADR-0007 | The resolve stage is handed a place the harvest already chose, so it needs a coordinate, not an index — and Places was the only vendor that could bill the card by default | Mapbox or Places behind a hard quota cap, if Tier 0 and Tier 1 miss more than P2.3's acceptance allows |
| 0016 | Progress + dispatch | Progress is pushed on state change with a bounded, backing-off stream; foreground jobs are dispatched via `workflow_dispatch` rather than waiting for cron. Amends ADR-0014 | A once-per-second poll behind SSE spends 86,400 of the free plan's 100,000 daily Hyperdrive queries per open tab, and the 5-minute cron floor makes a foreground progress bar look dead | Durable Objects or Cloudflare Queues, if the demo ever justifies a paid Workers plan |

Approved dependency list beyond the above: zod, drizzle-orm, hono, @tiptap/core and extensions, maplibre-gl, date-fns, ~~pino~~, vitest, playwright (types only; runtime comes from Solari). **pino went unused:** the repository is public, so the Actions log is public, and P0.4's logger is a closed union of typed events with no free-form field — a library whose whole affordance is `.info(anyObject)` is the wrong shape for a log nobody can take back. For LLM calls, OpenRouter speaks the OpenAI wire format, so `openai` is the client — pointed at OpenRouter's base URL, never at OpenAI.

## 5. Phase plan

Each phase has a goal, tasks sized to one executor session (roughly 1 to 3 hours of agent work), acceptance criteria, and a gate. Do not start a phase until the previous gate is met. Estimates assume one executor session per day; adjust freely, but keep the order.

### Phase 0: Foundation (about 1 week)

**Goal:** a repo where any future task can be done without setup work. Nothing user-facing.

Tasks:
- **P0.1** Scaffold monorepo per section 2.1, both scopes, empty packages. pnpm, Turborepo, Biome, Vitest, tsconfig base. `pnpm typecheck && pnpm test` green. Move cookbook examples to `examples/` untouched.
- **P0.2** `@samsara/core`: Zod schemas for every entity in section 3.1. `@dt/core`: section 3.2. Export inferred types. Tests: each schema parses a fixture, and `@samsara/core` has no `@dt/*` import.
- **P0.3** `@samsara/db`: Drizzle tables for 3.1, exported as a schema object, no migrations. `@dt/db`: travel tables for 3.2, composes the Samsara schema, owns `migrations/`. Local Postgres via docker-compose, seed script with one user and one trip.
- **P0.4** `@samsara/kernel`: `withBrowser` and `withSandbox` with registry, hard deadline, retry policy, structured logs. **The budget guard is three-metered from this task, not later** (section 2.4): minutes, LLM tokens, geocoding calls, each with a hard ceiling from section 8, each refusing its operation when exhausted and naming the meter in the error. Acceptance: a unit test drives each of the three meters past its ceiling and asserts the refusal; the `@live` test opens a proxied browser, hits ipify, asserts a real egress address, and closes. **Amended 11 September 2026:** the live test was specified against `th` and `th` turned out not to exist in the provider's pool (see section 1.4), so it runs against `sg`. Done: 62 unit tests green, live run 0.042 minutes for a probe session — the first real number for the minutes meter. Record ADRs 0001 to 0014.
- **P0.5** `apps/worker`: a scheduled-runner entry point (claim, drain, exit) against a `jobs` table with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, one no-op job type, a `Map<string, DomainPack>` registry with zero packs registered, and a shutdown path that closes every kernel session on SIGTERM — a runner can be cancelled mid-flight (ADR-0014). `apps/api`: Hono on Cloudflare Workers with a health endpoint, Supabase JWT middleware (ADR-0013), and Postgres through Hyperdrive. Acceptance includes a **measured CPU-per-request number against the free plan's 10 ms ceiling**, recorded in STATUS. If it does not fit, the fallback is Supabase Edge Functions, not a paid plan.
- **P0.6** Dev ergonomics: `pnpm dev` runs api + worker + web with hot reload. `.env.example`. `docs/STATUS.md` initialised.
- **P0.7** `tools/check-seam.ts` and `pnpm check:seam`: the lexicon check and the dependency-direction check from section 1.6, plus the `// seam:allow` counter. Wire into the Turbo task graph so `pnpm check` runs it, and into CI. Test it both ways: a fixture file with a forbidden word fails, the real tree passes. Record ADR-0009.
- **P0.8** *(added by the executor, 12 September 2026)* **Run the acceptance criteria below, literally, from a cold clone.** Not a review — an execution: clone into an empty directory, follow the README as written, time it; run the `@live` test and read the session row back out of Postgres with SQL; plant a travel word and watch `check:seam` fail. This was not a task in the original plan, and it should have been. Two of the three criteria were false when first executed and had been for days without producing a symptom. **The general lesson, for every phase after this one: an acceptance criterion that has never been executed is a claim, not a test, and the phase it belongs to is not finished.** Done: 31 s to a green check against a 10-minute budget; two silent-green defects and one real timezone-aliasing bug found and fixed. See STATUS.

Acceptance: a fresh clone reaches `pnpm dev` in under 10 minutes following README. The `@live` kernel test passes and its session row appears in Postgres. `pnpm check:seam` passes and demonstrably fails when a travel word is planted under `packages/samsara/`.

Gate: Aswin reviews the kernel interface, the `DomainPack` contract, and ADRs 0009 to 0014. Nothing else.

### Phase 1: Persona Lab (about 2 weeks)

**Goal:** create a persona in Bangkok, read what it sees on logged-out surfaces, and visualise how that differs from a US persona. This is the demo and the science experiment.

Tasks:
- **P1.0** **Signal-matrix experiment** (ADR-0015). One query, run across a matrix of viewpoints:
  egress country (`sg`, `us`) x locale (`th-TH`, `en-US`) x query language (Thai, English) x stored
  region preference (set, unset). Measure pairwise URL overlap in the top 20. Output: a table of
  which signals actually move the result and by how much, which sets the priority order for every
  adapter after it — and is the honest answer to "how do you get local content without a local IP".
  Budget: 16 cells x ~0.5 minutes, under 10 browser-minutes, well inside the per-task 30-minute cap.
  Do this **before** P1.3 to P1.6, so the adapters are built against measured signal weights rather
  than assumed ones.
  *Designed 12 September 2026 and corrected in four ways while being designed: the sixteen cells
  carry two replicates, because without a repeated cell the table cannot tell a signal from the
  surface's own minute-to-minute drift; the replicates are forced to span the whole run rather than
  sit next to their originals, so the noise floor is measured over the same timescale as the
  contrasts it calibrates; the run order is shuffled from a recorded seed, so ten minutes of drift
  does not land on the slowest-varying factor and get reported as its effect; and overlap divides by
  what could have been shared rather than by k, so a thin page is not read as a changed one.
  Eighteen sessions, ~9.0 minutes. The arithmetic is in `@samsara/harvest`, the query strings and
  the surface in `@dt/lab`, and the whole zero-cost half is tested with no network.*
- **P1.1** `@samsara/personas`: create persona (row + optional Solari profile + sticky proxy session key), health state machine, `keepalive` job (launch, visit two neutral local pages, save profile, update lastAliveAt). Ban detection heuristic: consecutive `Blocked` results flip health to `degraded`, three in a row to `banned`.
- **P1.2** `@samsara/sources` adapter interface: `harvest(ctx, query): Promise<RawItem[]>` where ctx carries persona, page, logger. Plus `@samsara/harvest`: run orchestration (persona x source x query), rate limiting, `HarvestRun` rows. Fixture-based tests for parsers, separated from fetching. **The adapter interface takes a query string and returns RawItems. It does not know what the caller will do with them.**
- **P1.3** Adapter: **YouTube regional trending + search** (logged-out, region param). Most stable target; proves the shape.
- **P1.4** Adapter: **TikTok logged-out search/discover** with stealth + the P1.0 viewpoint (Thai query, `th-TH` locale, `Asia/Bangkok`, `sg` egress — there is no `th` egress, see ADR-0015). TikTok is the surface most likely to gate on IP geolocation, so this is where the gap shows up if it shows up; report it as a gap rather than working around it. Two strategies: rendered page scrape, then intercepted XHR JSON. Record sessions for first 20 runs.
- **P1.5** Adapter: **Google Maps reviews** for a caller-supplied list of areas; Phase 1 runs it on Thai-language areas (Ari, Charoenkrung, Talat Noi, Yaowarat), but the area list is a parameter, not a constant in the adapter. Extract review text in native script, reviewer language.
- **P1.6** Adapter: **Pantip** (Thai forum) boards; board ids are a parameter. Plain HTML, good signal.
- **P1.7** Persona Lab UI (`apps/web`, internal route `/lab`): list personas, create one for a locality/country, trigger a harvest, view RawItems side by side for two personas on the same query. This is the "tourist vs local" split screen. Rough UI is fine; correctness of the comparison is not. The Lab is an engine-facing tool that happens to live in the travel app: it talks about personas, sources, and queries, not about places.
- **P1.8** Drift experiment: run the same query daily for 7 days from a `us` persona and a `th` persona. Store results. Plot overlap percentage over time in the Lab.

Acceptance: for the query "Bangkok street food", the th persona's top 20 items across adapters share less than 40% URL overlap with the us persona's. Recorded sessions show no captcha loops.

Gate: the split-screen comparison is convincing to Aswin as a demo. If overlap is above 60%, stop and redesign adapters before building the refine pipeline on top of noise.

### Phase 2: Harvest to Postcard pipeline (about 2 weeks)

**Goal:** RawItems become deduplicated, geocoded Places with evidence and a local score, and the first Place Postcards render. Equally: the pipeline that does it contains no travel code.

The split for every task below is the same. The **stage** is generic and lives in `@samsara/refine`. The **knowledge** is travel-specific and lives in `@dt/travel-pack`. If a task tempts you to put a place name, a dish, or a city in `@samsara/`, the pack is missing a hook — write it in QUESTIONS.md.

Tasks:
- **P2.1** `@samsara/llm`: interface `complete(prompt, schema)` with structured output, Anthropic + Gemini implementations, prompt files with versions, token/cost logging per call. Prompts are passed in as `PromptRef`; the pack owns its prompt text.
- **P2.2** `@samsara/refine` **extract stage** + the `DomainPack` contract from section 2.5: batch RawItems by `pack.extract.batchBy`, call the LLM with `pack.extract.prompt` and `mentionSchema`, write `Mention` rows. Then `@dt/travel-pack`'s mention schema and prompt (place name in native + roman script, dish, category, price hint, one supporting quote under 15 words, sentiment, whether the creator reads as local). Golden-set tests live with the pack: 50 hand-labelled Thai items, target 80% place-name recall.
- **P2.3** **resolve stage**: generic — take pending Mentions, call `pack.resolve`, cache by `(domainId, normalised key)`, mark `unresolvable` after N attempts. Then the travel resolver, tiered per ADR-0017: Tier 0 reads coordinates already present in the harvested artifact (geo tags, map links, addresses in captions and bios) — free, exact, and the primary path; Tier 1 matches against an OSM named-POI extract loaded into our own Postgres, trigram over `name` and `name:th`, biased to the city bbox; Tier 2 calls a free-tier hosted geocoder (LocationIQ or Geoapify, chosen here by measurement, never the public Nominatim server); Tier 3 is `unresolvable`. Every resolution records which tier won and a confidence score. Unresolved mentions still produce a `Place` with `geo: null`, flagged. Acceptance: on real harvested mentions, record the share resolved at each tier — if Tier 2 carries more than a fifth of them, Tiers 0 and 1 are underbuilt and that is the bug to fix, not the meter to raise.
- **P2.4** **dedup stage**: generic — walk `pack.dedupKeys(entity)` strongest-first, ask `repo.findByKeys`, call `repo.merge` on a hit. Merge preserves all Evidence. Then travel's keys: `externalRef` (exact, and only within the same source — two tiers agreeing is a merge, an OSM id and a geocoder id colliding numerically is not), normalised name + 150m radius (geo), embedding similarity above threshold (embedding).
- **P2.5** **score stage**: generic weighted scorer producing a `ScoreSet` with `because` explanations attached, from factor functions the pack supplies. Then travel's factors: `scores.local` from evidence mix (native-language share, creator-local share, source diversity, engagement ratio), `scores.tourist` from a keyword and source list (English-only, "top 10", listicle domains). Both explainable: the UI must be able to show why, and the generic `Explanation[]` is what it renders.
- **P2.6** Pipeline job: `harvest.run -> refine.run` chained through the `jobs` table with idempotency keys, both carrying `domainId`. Register the travel pack in `apps/worker`. Backfill from Phase 1 data.
- **P2.7** Place Postcard v0 in `@dt/ui`: local name + roman name, category, one evidence quote with source icon, local/tourist meter, map thumb. Render a grid of them at `/lab/places` sorted by `scores.local`.
- **P2.8** **Seam proof.** Write a throwaway second pack (target: under 60 lines, in `packages/samsara/refine/__fixtures__/`, never shipped) for a non-travel entity — a sensible one is "creator": resolve by channel URL, dedup by handle, score by posting cadence. Run the same pipeline over the same Phase 1 RawItems with `domainId: "creator"`. **Acceptance is that this required zero edits under `packages/samsara/` other than adding the fixture.** If it required more, the contract is wrong and P2.2 to P2.5 get revised before Phase 3. This task is cheap now and unaffordable later; do not skip it.

Acceptance: from 7 days of Bangkok harvests, at least 100 unique Places with geo, at least 30 with `scores.local` above 0.7, and Aswin can find 5 he has never heard of that check out on inspection. Plus P2.8 green.

Gate: quality review of the top 30. If more than a third are wrong (wrong place, closed, hallucinated), fix extract/resolve before Phase 3.

### Phase 3: Hundred Eyes (about 1 week)

**Goal:** paste a hotel URL, get a table of prices by country. Observation only.

Tasks:
- **P3.1** `@samsara/probe` fan-out engine: given a `ProbeTarget` and a country list, launch N sessions under the kernel's per-run budget, call the source adapter's `probe(page, target)`, write `Observation` rows. Generic: the engine never reads the payload it stores. Countries for v1: th, us, gb, in, jp, de, au, sg, run as a fan-out of 8.
- **P3.2** `@samsara/sources` Booking and Agoda adapters: URL -> canonical `parsed` target (property, dates, guests), and `probe()` returning a payload of displayed price, currency, and caveat text (member rate, taxes) plus a screenshot. Reject unsupported URLs cleanly. These are price-source adapters, not travel code: a geo-pricing customer would use the same two files unchanged.
- **P3.3** Normalisation: FX to USD via a daily-cached rate source, as a payload post-processor declared by the adapter. Observations keep both the raw and normalised figure, and their screenshot refs.
- **P3.4** Price Postcard v0 in `@dt/ui`: property name, cheapest locale highlighted, sparkline if watch enabled, "why prices differ" note (short, honest, no promise of savings).
- **P3.5** Watch mode: repeatable job per `ProbeTarget` with `watch: true`, daily cadence, notification row when cheapest drops more than 5%. Threshold and notification copy are travel-side; the scheduler is not.
- **P3.6** Flights spike (timeboxed to one session): try Google Flights rendered scrape. If blocked after two strategies, park it in the backlog and say so in STATUS.md. Hotels ship without it.

Acceptance: for 10 hotel URLs, all 8 countries return a price or an explicit `Blocked`/`NoPrice` in under 90 seconds per probe. Screenshots attached.

Gate: none beyond acceptance; this pillar is deliberately small.

### Phase 4: Trip Document and Postcards (about 3 weeks)

**Goal:** the product surface. A trip is a document you type into; Postcards are blocks; map and timeline are views.

Tasks:
- **P4.1** Tiptap editor with a custom `postcard` node that references a Postcard id and renders the matching component from `@dt/ui`. Persist document JSON on debounce. Version column for optimistic concurrency.
- **P4.2** Slash menu: `/place`, `/price`, `/note`, `/photo`, `/checklist`, `/link`. `/place` opens a search over the city's Places ranked by localScore, with the local/tourist meter visible in results.
- **P4.3** Intent parsing: on document save, extract dates, city, and interests from prose via `@samsara/llm` and update Trip fields. Non-destructive; user can override.
- **P4.4** Map view: MapLibre, all geo Postcards from the document, clustered, click to scroll the document to that block. Brand palette basemap.
- **P4.5** Timeline view: Postcards with time, grouped by day. Drag to reassign day writes back to the Postcard.
- **P4.6** Photo Postcard: upload to storage, EXIF geo/time extracted, becomes a mappable block. No AI segmentation in v1.
- **P4.7** Link Postcard: paste any URL; if it's a Booking/Agoda URL, offer to convert to a Price Postcard; if it's a TikTok/YouTube URL, run extract on it and offer a Place Postcard.
- **P4.8** Share link: read-only render of the document with map. This is the scrapbook export. Includes a small "Made with Doen Thang" mark.
- **P4.9** Design pass with `frontend-design` skill: type scale, palette (off-white and charcoal surfaces; neon pink, midnight blue, temple gold accents), Postcard as a physical object (slight rotation on hover, stamp-like source badges). Dry, confident copy. No glassmorphism.

Acceptance: Aswin plans a real 4-day Bangkok trip start to finish in the document without leaving it, and shares the link to one person who understands it without explanation.

Gate: usability session with 3 outside people. Record where they get stuck. Fix the top 3 before Phase 5.

### Phase 5: Daemons and seeded personas (about 1 week, plus legal check)

**Goal:** the OS runs when you're not looking, safely.

Tasks:
- **P5.1** Persona keepalive schedule: every persona `healthy` runs keepalive every 36 to 72 hours with jitter. Budget-guarded.
- **P5.2** Trip-driven harvest: when a Trip enters `planning` with a supported city, enqueue a nightly harvest for the trip's interests. New high-score Places surface in the document as a collapsed "The OS found 6 new places" block the user expands.
- **P5.3** Notifications: email digest (Resend or Supabase SMTP) for price drops and new places. No push in v1.
- **P5.4** Seeded persona spike, gated: one `seeded` TikTok persona for Bangkok with a written SeedPlan (watch local creators, dwell, search in Thai). Measure feed drift vs the anon persona over 10 days. Report to Aswin with ban events. **Do not scale beyond one persona per platform without architect sign-off and a ToS/legal read.**
- **P5.5** Ops dashboard at `/lab/kernel`: live sessions, minutes today by purpose and domain, budget remaining, blocked rate per adapter, persona health board. The design canvas's KERNEL screen is the reference.

Acceptance: worker runs 72 hours unattended with zero orphaned sessions and spend inside budget.

### Phase 6: Alpha launch (about 2 weeks)

**Goal:** 25 invited users, one city, a way to pay.

Tasks:
- **P6.1** Auth + onboarding: Supabase auth, first-run flow that creates a Trip from three questions (where, when, what do you care about).
- **P6.2** Plans: free (3 Places per day surfaced, 1 price target, no watch), pro (unlimited surfaced, 10 targets with watch, priority harvest). Stripe checkout. Budget guard reads plan.
- **P6.3** Landing page on Astro (separate repo or `apps/landing`), built around the split-screen demo video: same query, tourist feed vs local feed, 30 seconds, no voiceover needed.
- **P6.4** Tokyo adapters: Tabelog + YouTube region jp + Google Maps reviews in Japanese. Proves the adapter model with a second script.
- **P6.5** Legal and trust: privacy policy, data retention (raw HTML 30 days, screenshots 90 days, Evidence indefinitely), robots and rate-limit policy per adapter written down, "how this works" page that is honest about what personas are.
- **P6.6** Instrumentation: PostHog or similar for activation (document created, first Postcard, share link opened), retention cohorts, harvest quality feedback (thumbs on Place Postcards feeds back into scoring).

Acceptance: 25 users, 10 with a shared document, at least 3 paying. Day-30 retention measured (industry baseline is 3 to 5%; anything above 15% for people with a trip in the window means the OS thesis is holding).

### Phase 7 and beyond (backlog, not planned)

- Agent Postcards: sandbox agent executes a bounded action (hold a booking on a site with a legit local flow), with a human confirm step and full session recording.
- Remote localized desktop: VNC desktop in-country for the rare site that needs it. Pro feature, metered.
- Visual extract: crop a region of a screenshot, reverse image search, generate a Place Postcard.
- Multiplayer documents via Yjs.
- Flights in Hundred Eyes if the Phase 3 spike found a viable path.
- Persona marketplace: localities as packs, community-contributed SeedPlans.
- **Vertical two on Samsara.** Not planned, deliberately. When a real buyer appears, the candidates in rough order of fit to what will already be built: algorithm auditing (what a given demographic in a given country is shown, for researchers, journalists, regulators), geo-pricing intelligence for SaaS and e-commerce, localised SERP and ad monitoring, in-language market and brand research, diaspora feeds. Each is a domain pack plus a UI; none should need an engine change. If one does, that is the signal the seam is in the wrong place — fix it then, with a paying customer telling you where.

## 6. Product design principles (for anyone touching `apps/web` or `@dt/ui`)

1. **The document is the product.** Every feature is reachable from inside the trip document. Views (map, timeline, lab) are derived from it, never a second source of truth.
2. **Postcards are objects, not widgets.** They have provenance (evidence), a place in time and space, and a state. They can be stale. Show staleness; never silently refresh what a user pinned.
3. **Show the algorithm.** The local/tourist meter is explainable on click. If we claim something is a hidden gem, we show who said so, in what language, when.
4. **Honest hooks.** Hundred Eyes says "this is what each country is shown", not "save $400". Users are smart; the screenshot speaks.
5. **Bangkok is the brand, not the theme.** Palette and type from the moodboard; no Thai pattern wallpaper, no tuk-tuk illustrations. The energy comes from motion and density, not decoration.
6. **Dry over cute.** Copy is short and confident. Loading states describe what the kernel is doing ("Reading Yaowarat from a Thai IP") because that is the actual magic.

---

## 7. Guardrails (executors enforce these in code, not in comments)

- **Rate limits per adapter**, configured in one file, defaulting to polite (1 request per 3 to 5 seconds per persona per site).
- **Robots awareness**: adapters log robots.txt status for the paths they touch. Logged-out surfaces only in Phases 1 to 4.
- **No interaction on real users' content** from personas: no likes, follows, comments, DMs. Personas read.
- **No PII from harvested content** stored beyond creator handle and public engagement numbers. Reviews stored as extracts, not full text, after 30 days.
- **Kill switch**: a `kernel:halt` row in the `jobs`-adjacent control table that makes `withBrowser` refuse to launch. Checked on every launch, not cached. Ops dashboard button. Test it in Phase 5.
- **User credential rule**: v1 never asks for or stores a user's third-party social login.
- **Seam**: `pnpm check:seam` is part of `pnpm check` and part of CI. A red seam check is a broken build, not a warning. The `// seam:allow` escape hatch is counted and printed on every run; above five, the architect redesigns the seam rather than the executor adding a sixth.

---

## 8. Cost model and budgets

**The demo runs under a hard $20 ceiling** (Aswin, 11 September 2026). That is a constraint on the architecture, not a note to act on later: the kernel's budget guard enforces it from P0.4, and section 2.4 defines the shape. Do not hardcode prices anywhere in code — read current rates from console.getsolari.com and openrouter.ai/models, derive a count, and put the count in the constants file with the rate in a comment.

Three meters, each with an allocation and a hard ceiling:

| Meter | Allocation | Ceiling, as a count | Where the number comes from |
|---|---|---|---|
| Solari runtime | ~$8 | 4,000 browser-minutes | ~$0.002/min from the Starter calculator. A disciplined demo needs about 1,000; the ceiling is loose on purpose because this is the cheap meter. |
| LLM extraction | ~$3 | 20M input + 4M output tokens | Rate depends on the routed model (ADR-0012) and must be read at P2.1, not assumed. A Flash-class model on OpenRouter is roughly an order of magnitude under a frontier model; the ceiling is set so that even a bad model choice cannot exhaust it silently. |
| Geocoding | $0 | 800 hosted calls | **No longer a spend** (ADR-0017). Tier 0 reads coordinates out of the harvested artifact and Tier 1 queries an OSM extract in our own Postgres; both are free. The count now guards a free tier's daily quota and, more usefully, guards us — a resolver needing more than a few hundred hosted calls a day is failing at Tiers 0 and 1. |

About $9 stays unallocated as headroom — up from $4, because ADR-0017 returned the geocoding allocation to it. It is reserve against undercount, not budget that became available to spend.

Standing rules, every one of which is cheaper than raising a ceiling:

- **Parser iteration opens no browsers.** P1.2 separates fetching from parsing precisely so adapter work runs against stored fixtures. This is the single largest saving available and it is already in the plan.
- **Refine runs cost zero Solari minutes.** They replay stored RawItems. Phase 2 can iterate as much as it likes on the cheapest meter — which is also what makes the ADR-0012 model bake-off affordable.
- **Batch roughly 20 RawItems per LLM call.** The extraction prompt is identical every time; sending it once per item is pure waste. This belongs in P2.1's design, not bolted on afterwards.
- **Keep the mention schema tight.** Output tokens dominate the LLM bill. "One supporting quote under 15 words" is already doing budget work.
- **Cache resolutions permanently**, keyed by normalised name. Coordinates do not change. Tier 0 (coordinates already in the artifact) first, then the local OSM extract, then a hosted geocoder — ADR-0017. Not the public Nominatim server: its usage policy caps recurring scripts at 4 requests/minute and names systematic querying as grounds for a ban.
- **Recording off by default.** On for the first 20 runs of a new adapter (P1.4), then off.
- **Per-task dev budget: 30 browser-minutes.** Above that, stop and write to QUESTIONS.md.
- **`kernel:halt`** (section 7) is the manual override for when a meter misbehaves faster than a counter catches it.

**Answered 11 September 2026 (Aswin): the $20 *is* the usage credit. There is no month of free
runtime underneath it.** Spending past it bills a credit card, and Aswin does not want that. So the
table above is the real exposure, and three things follow, all of them load-bearing:

- **The ceiling is a stop, not a warning.** The guard refuses at `used >= ceiling` and names the
  meter. There is no soft mode, no "log and continue". This is why `BudgetGuard.check` treats a
  meter sitting exactly on its ceiling as exhausted even for a `requested: 0` caller.
- **Ceilings sit below the credit line, because our counter undercounts.** We meter what we observe;
  the provider meters what it ran. A runner killed mid-session leaves a row `running` and a VM
  billing until its idle window expires — ADR-0014 makes that routine, not an edge case — and
  rounding runs the same direction. The allocations above total ~$16 of $20, and the ~$4 left over
  is **reserve against undercount**, not spare budget. Do not allocate it.
- **Nothing here can bill the card any more.** Solari stops when its credit is gone. OpenRouter is
  prepaid, so it also stops. Google Places was the one exception — it bills by default once its free
  credit is exhausted — and **ADR-0017 removed it from the system entirely** rather than containing
  it behind a quota cap. No Google API key is created, so there is nothing left to cap. The standing
  obligation this section carried into Phase 2 is closed by deletion.

Measured, not estimated: a probe session — open a residential-proxied browser, load one page, read
it, close — cost **0.057 minutes** on 11 September 2026. About 0.0014% of the minutes ceiling.

Unit economics sanity check to run at Phase 6: cost per active user per month vs $8 pro price. If harvest alone costs more than $3 per user per month, cut cadence before cutting features.

## 9. Metrics that decide the next phase

| Phase | Metric | Threshold to proceed |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | URL overlap between th and us personas, same query | under 40% |
| 2 | Top-30 Places manually verified as real, open, correctly located | above 66% |
| 2 | Engine files edited to run the P2.8 non-travel pack through the same pipeline | 0 |
| 3 | Probes returning price or explicit non-price in under 90s | above 90% |
| 4 | Outsiders who understand a shared document unaided | 2 of 3 |
| 5 | Orphaned sessions in 72h soak | 0 |
| 6 | Day-30 retention among users with a trip in window | above 15% |

## 10. Decisions and open questions

### Decided 11 September 2026 (recorded as ADRs 0009 to 0014)

- The layer is a **service layer**, not an operating system. "OS" survives as product-facing language for Doen Thang only.
- The service layer is **domain-agnostic and named Samsara**. Two package scopes in one repo, seam enforced by `pnpm check:seam`.
- A vertical is a **domain pack**: a plain TS object implementing `DomainPack`. The engine owns the whole extract/resolve/dedup/score pipeline; travel supplies the knowledge.
- The engine does **not** get a generic `Entity` table. Each pack owns its own table behind an `EntityRepo`. Reconsider only if a third vertical wants cross-domain queries.
- **The demo has a hard $20 ceiling.** The kernel's budget guard is three-metered from P0.4 — minutes, LLM tokens, geocoding calls — with ceilings expressed as counts. Section 8 holds the numbers.
- **OpenRouter is the LLM gateway** and the model for each task is an env var, not a literal (ADR-0012). The extraction model is chosen at P2.1 by measurement against stored RawItems, which cost nothing to replay.
- **Supabase Auth**, not Clerk (ADR-0013). The API verifies the JWT and passes `sub` down as an opaque `ownerId`. No RLS in v1.
- **Cloudflare free plan for `apps/web` and `apps/api`; GitHub Actions for `apps/worker`; no Redis, no BullMQ** (ADR-0014). Section 2.2 is rewritten around this. P0.5 is unblocked.

### Still open for Aswin (answer in QUESTIONS.md before Phase 0 ends)

1. *Answered 11 September 2026 — **Cloudflare free plan for web and api, GitHub Actions for the worker, no Redis**. See ADR-0014. Left numbered in place so references to later questions still resolve.* Fully closed: the repository is **public** (`AswinBehera/solari-TravelOS`), so Actions minutes are unmetered and section 8 stays at three meters. The cost of public is that the Actions log is public — see ADR-0014's logging rule, enforced in P0.4.
2. *Answered 11 September 2026 — **the $20 is the usage credit itself**; anything beyond it bills Aswin's card, which is not acceptable. Section 8 rewritten: the ceiling is a hard stop, the unallocated ~$4 is reserve against our own undercount rather than spare budget, and the remaining card exposure is Google Places, which needs a quota cap before Phase 2.*
3. *Answered 11 September 2026 — **Supabase Auth**. See ADR-0013. Left numbered in place so references to questions 4 to 8 elsewhere still resolve.*
4. Does the landing page live in this monorepo (`apps/landing`, Astro) or in the solitaryfunc.fyi Astro setup?
5. Name lock: "Doen Thang" as product name, or working title? Affects domain and mark in Phase 4.8.
6. Should the Persona Lab be user-visible at alpha (as a "how it works" flex) or stay internal?
7. Does "Samsara" get a public identity at some point (its own page, its own domain), or does it stay an internal name until a second vertical has a buyer? (Architect lean: internal. Naming a platform publicly before it has two customers invites you to build for the imaginary second one.)
8. `@dt/*` is a placeholder scope for the travel packages and is tied to the "Doen Thang" name lock in question 5. Confirm both together.
9. *Answered 11 September 2026 — **ADR-0015**: keep Bangkok, treat the viewpoint as a stack of signals rather than an IP, and measure which of them actually move the result (new task P1.0). Option (c) in substance, with (a)'s Singapore egress as the weakest ingredient rather than the premise. Asked: **`th` is not on Solari's near-term roadmap** (Aswin, 11 September 2026), so nothing waits for it and the signal stack is the design rather than an interim measure.* Original framing kept below because P1.4's acceptance criterion depends on it:
   **Bangkok, without a Thai IP.** Solari's residential pool has no `th` (section 1.4, found in P0.4). Three ways forward, and they are not equivalent: (a) run Bangkok personas through `sg` and say so in the Persona Lab, accepting that "what a local sees" becomes "what a regional neighbour sees"; (b) make Tokyo the first city, since `jp` is in the pool and section 1.4 already names it second; (c) keep `th` as the target and shape the persona through account locale, language, and search terms rather than IP, treating egress country as one signal of several. (a) keeps the brand and weakens the claim; (b) keeps the claim and costs the brand; (c) is the most honest about how these platforms actually localise, and the most work. Worth asking Solari whether `th` is on their roadmap before choosing.

## Appendix C: Glossary

- **Samsara**: the domain-agnostic service layer over Solari. Personas are incarnations; Samsara is the machinery that runs them, remembers them, and reports what each one saw. Package scope `@samsara/*`.
- **Doen Thang**: the travel product built on Samsara. Vertical one. Package scope `@dt/*`.
- **Situated observation**: the horizontal primitive. What a specific identity, in a specific place, was actually shown — captured repeatably, on a schedule, with evidence.
- **Domain pack**: the object a vertical implements to drive the generic pipeline. Entity schema, prompts, resolver, dedup keys, scoring factors, sources, queries. Section 2.5.
- **The seam**: the enforced boundary between `packages/samsara/` and `packages/travel/`. Section 1.6.
- **Persona**: a Solari browser profile plus a proxy country and sticky IP, treated as a long-lived identity that reads local feeds.
- **Harvest**: one adapter run by one persona for one query, producing RawItems.
- **Refine**: the pipeline from RawItems to Places with Evidence and scores.
- **Postcard**: a typed block in a trip document with optional geo and time. The only unit the map and timeline understand.
- **Hundred Eyes**: the price observatory.
- **Kernel**: the Solari session wrapper with registry, budgets, and deadlines. Nothing touches Solari without it. An orchestrator, not a kernel; the name is kept because the ops screen is called `/kernel` and the metaphor is load-bearing in the product.
