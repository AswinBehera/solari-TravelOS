/**
 * The parser, run against bytes TikTok actually sent.
 *
 * Everything in `parse.test.ts` is a tree I wrote, and its header says what that
 * can and cannot prove: a hand-built tree shows the predicate accepts what I
 * *think* an item looks like. This file is the other half. One browser session
 * was spent from a Singapore egress with a `vi-VN` persona, on 2026-09-13, asking
 * `bánh mì`; the capture is checked in; every assertion below is about what came
 * back rather than about what I expected to come back.
 *
 * That distinction is sharper for TikTok than for any other adapter here, because
 * this parser recognises items **structurally** — a digit `id`, a string `desc`,
 * an author or stats block — and a structural matcher is the kind that passes its
 * author's tests and returns hashtags in production.
 *
 * **The fixture is not a screenshot of a website.** It is the redacted payload,
 * and `capture.ts`'s `REDACTED_KEYS` is what did the redacting. The last test
 * here re-runs that audit against the file, because the list grows every time
 * somebody reads a real page and a fixture that was clean against the old list
 * has not been checked against the new one.
