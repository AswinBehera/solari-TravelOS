/**
 * Hand-built payloads, and the header on `tiktok/parse.test.ts` applies here too:
 * these establish what the parser *does*, not that the shape it expects is the
 * shape Google sends. Only `fixture.test.ts` can do the second thing, and it does
 * not exist yet because no session has been paid for.
 *
 * For this adapter the two tests split unusually cleanly, because `inpage.ts` did
 * the extraction: everything below is a judgement made from strings, and a string
 * is a string whether it came from Google or from this file. What a real capture
 * will settle is whether those strings arrive at all.
