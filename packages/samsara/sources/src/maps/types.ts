/**
 * What a Google Maps capture holds.
 *
 * The other two adapters in this package store a tree that a source serialised for
 * its own client, and parse it later for free. Maps cannot be read that way. Its
 * embedded payload — `APP_INITIALIZATION_STATE` — is nested arrays with no keys in
 * them at all: a review's text is at some index of some index, and there is nothing
 * to search a tree *for*. A positional parser written from memory fails the same way
 * whether the position moved or was never known, which is the one failure mode a
 * per-minute budget cannot absorb.
 *
 * So this adapter reads the rendered DOM, and the consequence is stated rather than
 * hidden: `parse` has no DOM, so field extraction happens in the half that spends.
 * The line that survives is narrower and still worth having —
 *
 *   **the in-page half selects and copies strings; it does not interpret them.**
 *
 * `readMapsPage` returns the raw `aria-label`, the raw relative time, the raw
 * helpful-count label. Turning "5 stars" into a number, a count into an integer, or
 * a script into a language stays in `parse.ts`, where being wrong is free. Changing
 * our mind about what a rating *is* still costs nothing; recovering from a selector
 * change now costs a session, which is why `nodeCounts` and `tabLabels` exist.
 */

 * `search` asks where something is; `reviews` asks what was said about one entity.

 * this is the column a stored row is grouped and re-parsed by, and a result card is
 * not the same kind of evidence as a review.
