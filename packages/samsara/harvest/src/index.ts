// @samsara/harvest — Run orchestration: identity x source x query -> RawItem[].
//
// Two halves, built in two tasks. The measurement half (P1.0) is a factorial design
// over viewpoint signals (`matrix.ts`) and the comparison of what each cell
// returned (`overlap.ts`); both are pure and network-free, because the expensive
// part of an experiment is the sessions and none of the arithmetic reading them
// should need one.
//
// The orchestration half (P1.2) is `run.ts`: open a session through a persona's
// viewpoint, let an adapter capture, archive the bytes before parsing them, write
// the items, close the run, and tell the persona what the source thought of it.
// `pace.ts` is the per-source interval, and is honest in its own header about what
// an in-process limiter can and cannot promise across a scheduled runner's exit.
//
// `./postgres` is a separate entry point, like the kernel's, so importing this
// package does not drag a database driver into a runtime that cannot load one.
