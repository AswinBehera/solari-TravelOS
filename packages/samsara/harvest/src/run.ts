/**
 * One identity asking one source one question, once (plan section 3, `HarvestRun`).
 *
 * The orchestration exists to hold five things in the right order, and the order is
 * the whole content of this file:
 *
 * 1. The run row is written **before** the browser opens. A session that is killed
 *    mid-harvest — the normal residue of a cancelled Actions run under ADR-0014 —
 *    must leave a `running` row that somebody can reconcile, not nothing at all.
 * 2. The capture is archived **before** it is parsed. Parsing is the step most
 *    likely to throw on a page that changed shape overnight, and a throw that
 *    discards the bytes proving what changed turns a ten-minute fix into a
 *    re-harvest.
 * 3. Items are written before the run is marked `ok`, so `ok` never describes a
 *    run whose items are not there.
 * 4. The run is finished on every path, including the failures.
 * 5. The persona is told what happened, because a refusal is a health verdict and
 *    the whole ban detector is downstream of somebody recording one.
