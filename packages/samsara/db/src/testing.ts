/**
 * One database, three test packages, and `turbo run test` runs them at once.
 *
 * Every `.pg.test.ts` file in this repository starts by truncating the tables it
 * is about to use, because a test that inherits the previous run's rows is a test
 * that passes for the wrong reason. That is correct in isolation and wrong in
 * parallel: Turbo runs `@samsara/kernel`, `@samsara/personas` and
 * `@samsara/harvest` concurrently against the same `DATABASE_URL`, so one
 * package's `truncate ... cascade` deletes rows another package inserted two
 * milliseconds ago. The symptom is a handful of `expected undefined to be 8`
 * failures that move around between runs and disappear entirely at
 * `--concurrency=1` — which is to say, the most expensive kind of failure to
 * read, because it looks like a bug in whichever test happened to lose.
 *
 * The fix is a **Postgres advisory lock**, which is the database's own mutex and
 * therefore works across processes without any of them knowing about each other.
 * The alternative — `--concurrency=1` for the whole repo — serialises twenty-six
 * tasks to fix a conflict between three of them, and it fixes it by accident: the
 * next package that opens a connection reintroduces the bug silently.
 *
 * The lock is **session-scoped**, so it must be held on one connection that
 * nothing else borrows. `postgres`'s pool hands out whichever connection is free,
 * so this opens its own with `max: 1` rather than sharing the test's client.
