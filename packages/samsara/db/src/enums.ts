/**
 * Postgres enums are derived from the Zod enums in `@samsara/core` rather than
 * retyped here. A schema and its database type cannot drift if only one of them
 * is written down.
 *
 * The cast is parameterised by the literal union rather than widened to `string`.
 * Widening compiles just as well and costs the caller everything: `sessions.purpose`
 * reads back as `string`, and every consumer has to re-narrow a value the database
 * already guarantees. `values()` wants a mutable non-empty tuple, which is the only
 * reason a cast is needed at all.
