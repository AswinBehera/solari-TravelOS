/**
 * One valid fixture per engine entity.
 *
 * Deliberately domain-neutral. The first draft of this file used the travel
 * vertical's vocabulary to make the examples concrete, which would have failed
 * `pnpm check:seam` — correctly, because if the engine's own fixtures need a
 * vertical's words to be legible, the schemas are not actually agnostic. The
 * domain here is a made-up one called `atlas`.
 *
 * Exported rather than inlined in the test so downstream packages can build on
 * these instead of inventing their own shapes.
