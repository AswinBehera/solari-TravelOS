/**
 * The budget guard (plan section 2.4). Three meters, not one.
 *
 * Two honest limitations, stated here because they are properties of the design
 * rather than bugs to be found later:
 *
 * 1. **The guard refuses before, and accounts after.** Browser minutes are not
 *    knowable in advance, so the guard checks that a meter is under its ceiling
 *    before an operation starts and records the actual cost when it ends. The
 *    maximum overshoot is therefore one operation — bounded by that operation's
 *    hard deadline. At a 4-minute deadline against a 4,000-minute ceiling, that is
 *    0.1%. Where the cost *is* knowable up front (tokens, geocoding calls), pass it
 *    as `requested` and the refusal becomes exact.
 * 2. **It is not a distributed lock.** Two runners can both pass a check at 99% of
 *    a ceiling. The `add` path is an atomic upsert so the count stays correct, and
 *    the next check refuses. For a demo with one scheduled runner this is
 *    sufficient; it would not be for concurrent production traffic.
