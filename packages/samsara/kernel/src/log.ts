/**
 * Structured logs (plan section 2.4, item 5). One JSON line per event.
 *
 * The repository is public, which means the GitHub Actions log is public
 * (ADR-0014). So the defence against logging a secret is not a redaction denylist
 * — those are only ever as good as their last update — it is that **the event
 * types have nowhere to put one**. There is no `payload`, no `meta`, no
 * `Record<string, unknown>` anywhere below. Adding a field is a reviewed diff in
 * this file, which is the only place where "should this be public?" gets asked.
 *
 * Consequently: no request bodies, no harvested text, no URLs with query strings,
 * no values read from `process.env`. Counts, durations, ids, and error classes.
