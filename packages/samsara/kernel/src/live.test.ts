/**
 * The `@live` test. This is the only test in the repository that spends money.
 *
 * It is skipped unless `SOLARI_LIVE=1`, so `pnpm test` never opens a browser —
 * `pnpm test:live` does. It stays visible in the default run as a skipped case
 * rather than being excluded by filename, because a live test nobody remembers
 * exists is a live test nobody runs before shipping.
 *
 * Cost: one browser session, a few seconds, a single page load. Well under a cent.
 *
 * **Reading a failure.** The provider may be in a maintenance window. The
 * assertions below are written so the two cases are never confused:
 *
 *   - `upstream` — Solari is unreachable or returned a 5xx. **Not our bug.** The
 *     test says so explicitly and fails with that word in the message.
 *   - anything else — ours.
 *
 * The counters here are in-memory on purpose: a live test must not write to the
 * real budget counters, or a CI run would spend the demo's allowance on itself.
 * The minutes are still measured and printed, which is the number worth knowing.
