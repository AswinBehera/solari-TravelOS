/**
 * The provider, as the kernel needs it — and no more than that.
 *
 * These interfaces exist so every test above this line runs without the network,
 * without an API key, and without spending a minute. They are also the seam where
 * a provider outage is simulated: a fake that throws `ECONNREFUSED` proves the
 * `upstream` path works, which is the only way to know that a real maintenance
 * window will be reported as the provider's problem rather than ours.
 *
 * The shapes mirror `@solarisdk/browser` and `@solarisdk/sdk` (plan section 2.3)
 * but deliberately narrowly: `newPage` and `close`, nothing else. A page is
 * `unknown` to this file — Playwright's own type belongs to the caller, and
 * importing it here would drag a browser automation library into a package the
 * Workers runtime may one day have to load.

/**
 * What the browser claims to be, as opposed to where its packets come from.
 *
 * These are the levers that matter and the ones nobody thinks about, because the
 * proxy country is the visible knob. A platform deciding what to show a visitor
 * reads, roughly in descending order of weight: the account's region, the query's
 * language, any explicit region preference it has stored, the browser's locale
 * and timezone, and only then the egress IP. A `us` session asking in Vietnamese
 * with a `vi-VN` browser on `Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh` is closer to a local viewpoint than
 * a `vn` IP asking in English would be — if a `vn` IP were available at all, which
 * on this provider it is not (see `countries.ts`).
 *
 * The provider does **not** set these. Its `newPage()` gives you the pool's
 * default context, which is `en-US` and UTC — i.e. nobody. Every session this
 * kernel opens without a viewpoint is a session pretending to be an American.
