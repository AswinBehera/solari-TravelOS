/**
 * The queue against a real Postgres.
 *
 * This file exists for one property the in-memory store is structurally unable to
 * check: `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`. Two runners overlapping is not a rare case
 * under ADR-0014 — a cron run and a `workflow_dispatch` run can be awake at the
 * same instant by design — and "two runners never claim the same row" is the
 * single assumption everything else here rests on. A fake that runs one statement
 * at a time cannot fail that test, which means it cannot pass it either.
 *
 * Runs whenever `DATABASE_URL` is set, and **fails loudly when it is not** unless
 * `SAMSARA_NO_DB=1` says the omission is deliberate.
 *
 * The earlier version of this comment said "skipped unless `DATABASE_URL` is set,
 * so `pnpm test` stays runnable on a machine with no Docker", and that was the
 * second time the same mistake was made here. The first was Turbo's strict env
 * mode swallowing the variable (P0.7); this was P0.8's fresh-clone run, where
 * following the README exactly produced `67 passed | 14 skipped`, exit 0, and no
 * coverage at all of the one component with real concurrency in it. Fixing the
 * plumbing is not enough: a silent skip is a green run that means nothing, and the
 * only durable fix is to make the absence an event. Opting out is still allowed —
 * it just has to be said out loud, which is the same bargain the seam checker's
 * allow comments strike. (Writing that marker literally here made the checker fail
 * this very file for an unused allow, which is the check being right.)
