/**
 * Retry policy (plan section 2.4, item 4). Up to two retries, with jitter.
 *
 * What must *not* be retried is the interesting half:
 *
 * - `blocked` — the page refused us. Retrying spends minutes to be refused again,
 *   and worse, it trains the target that this persona is a bot. The adapter's next
 *   strategy is the correct response, which is why `blocked` is surfaced rather
 *   than swallowed.
 * - `budget` — the meter is exhausted. Retrying is the one thing a budget guard
 *   exists to stop.
 * - `config` — a proxy without stealth will be invalid the third time too.
 * - `timeout` — our deadline already fired. Retrying doubles the spend on work that
 *   was too slow, and the caller can choose to re-queue with a longer deadline if
 *   that is actually what it wants.
 *
 * Which leaves `upstream` (the provider failed — worth another go, they may be
 * mid-deploy) and `internal` (which is worth exactly one retry, because a genuine
 * bug will reproduce and the log should say so rather than looping).
