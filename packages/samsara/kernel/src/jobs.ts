 * The queue's port (ADR-0004 as amended by ADR-0014), alongside the session and
 * counter ports in `ports.ts` and for the same reason: every test above this line
 * runs without Postgres, and the real implementation lives in `stores/postgres.ts`.
 *
 * It sits in `@samsara/kernel` rather than in a package of its own because
 * section 2.1 fixes the nine engine packages and both `apps/api` (which enqueues
 * and reads) and `apps/worker` (which claims and drains) need it. The kernel
 * already owns the other two pieces of runtime plumbing those apps share — the
 * budget counters and the session registry — and a queue whose rows outlive the
 * process is the same kind of thing. Recorded as an executor decision in STATUS.
